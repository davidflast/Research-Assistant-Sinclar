I write to enthusiastically recommend that Adrienne Hosek be invited
to present a poster at PolMeth. She is a PhD candidate in Political
Science at the University of California, Berkeley with a focus is on
American politics and methodology. Her research examines the
relationship between income inequality and voting behavior. In
particular, she is interested in how the particular factors generating
disparities in the United States change individuals' perceptions of
their economic well-being and how these expectations alter the
traditional models of income and voting.

Adrienne is developing new methods for dynamic information collection
systems for use in online survey experiments. To better assess voter
preferences over complex policy issues, Hosek is creating a new survey
methodology that dynamically changes what questions are asked next
based on prior answers. The technique applies the principal of greedy
information gain to improve evaluation quality when conditions
restrict the ability of researchers to perform lengthy,
resource-intensive data collection and verification methods. The
survey system takes a dynamic approach, generating a static but
entropy-optimal question ordering that prioritizes questions which
yield the greatest gains in information in the shortest possible time
frame. This method allows her to test how income volatility affects
individual support for tax progressivity.

Adrienne also combines panel data on income and consumption with data
on voting to assess how the relationship between earnings and voting
behavior has changed over time in America and Britain as access to
credit has expanded in these countries. This research applies
non-parametric matching methods to imputation analysis, improving the
ability of researches to augment public opinion surveys in political
science with data from other fields.

Adrienne Hosek is a recipient of the Integrated Graduate Education
Research and Training Program (IGERT) fellowship in Politics,
Economics, Psychology, and Public Policy and has presented at the
Midwest Political Science Association conference, as well as the
Summer Methods Meeting for the Society for Political Methodology. She
served as a graduate student instructor for several graduate-level
methods courses at UC Berkeley.

Adrienne would be a wonderful addition to the PolMeth poster
session. Her poster will present novel methodological work on dynamic
survey design an important substantive question, the effects of income
inequality.

I am writing in strong support of Nick Beauchamp's application to
attend the 2011 Summer Methodology Meeting. Nick is a 5th year
PhD student at NYU.  Nick is one of the two most technically
adept and innovative students I have ever worked with. Nick
has produced at least three original methodology papers in
his time in grad school. One provided the best accounting of
the shape of utility functions that I have seen. Another
adapts text-coding methods for ideological scaling in a novel way.
And the third, develops a methods of text-based analysis
to estimate the effectiveness of television advertisements.
The paper he has proposed to present at this summer's methods
meeting is a fourth original paper.

While analysis of blogs seems to be somewhat of a cottage
industry -- for good reason, they provide huge amounts of
text to analyze -- Nick is interested not just in WHAT people
are talking about, but in who is talking to whom, and more
importantly - who is trying to persuade who, and how?
I have every expectation this work will be as strong as
Nick's other work. His preliminary analysis is very promising.

The TV ads paper develops the methodology to estimate the effect
of _individual_ TV ads on vote-shares, and performs a huge brute-force
data analysis to estimate the effectiveness of over 350 individual
ads used in the 2004 US presidential election.  He does this by
regressing vote-share against each add separately, and averaging
over predictions to get the effect of ads. While the estimate
of any one ads effect is not necessarily precise, Nick does extensive
out of sample testing to confirm the ability of the approach to
accurately predict overall ad effect.  And after estimating
the effect of each ad on vote-share, Nick breaks down the ads to
their constituent components -- words -- and uses assorted methods
of automated text analysis to determine which words are most effective.



This is the most sophisticated analyses of campaign effects I have
seen. And while it is one paper -- though a 76 page paper --  it would
easily qualify as a large piece of a dissertation.  We learn the aggregate
effects of the ads Kerry and Bush ran, we learn what alternative
ad strategies would have netted each campaign  (i.e., what if each
campaign could more accurately have identified their effective ads
and used their resources to run those ads exclusively), and we learn
what sort of words are most effective for Democrats and what sorts
of words are most effective for Republicans. And, we have a methodology
for estimating the effects of television ads.

This is first rate, original work. I strongly urge you to invite Nick
to the methods meeting and provide funding for him. Nick applied
last year and did not receive an invitation. No doubt there were
many fine applicants. But I feel very strongy that he is worthy
of an invitation in his final year as a grad student.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like
additional information.

Dear Selection Committee:

I write to offer my most enthusiastic recommendation that Daniel Biggers be invited to the 2011 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.  Dan is currently in his fifth year of graduate training at the University of Maryland, and will be on the job market in the Fall.  He is by far the strongest student in his cohort and is widely regarded as one of the best and most promising students to go through our program.  Having had Dan in two of my courses, MLE (GVPT 729a) and Participation (GVPT 878d), witnessing him during our bi-weekly American politics workshops, serving on his Political Methodology Comprehensive exam and dissertation committees, having him as my TA for Advanced Quantitative Methods for Political Science Data (GVPT 722), and co-authoring with him, I feel I am qualified to comment on his work.    

Dan attended the Summer Meeting for the first time in 2009.  His participation was a clear success.  Dan recently published an article based on his poster in Political Behavior – it is the lead article in the next issue.  This attests to the quality of his research and his ability to incorporate suggestions made to him during his poster presentation.  Dan took full advantage of the opportunities presented by the structure of the Meeting, contributing to the panel and poster sessions by asking insightful questions, and making contacts with a number of faculty members from other institutions who share similar interests.  

I have talked extensively with Dan about his proposed poster and it is clear that the work is on its way to making a contribution.  Dan is working on a project that investigates the performance of Thomsen’s estimator for ecological inference.  Specifically, he is studying how the estimator performs as the number of aggregation units, and the diversity of the sample change.  Presenting at the conference will expose him to a wider set of comments that are sure to improve his work.

In addition to having the utmost confidence that Dan will produce an excellent poster, I believe that Dan will benefit more than most from the experience.  Dan is extremely personable and has a good sense of humor, but he is on the shy side; continued exposure to the methods community in a setting where one simply has to meet new people will surely provide additional connections with those who have similar interests and perhaps spark opportunities for collaboration.  

Dan’s progress in the program is a model I wish all of our students would follow.  He used courses to develop ideas for papers and presented these at a variety of internal and external conferences.  For example, his Political Behavior article started as a seminar paper in his second year and was revised for an internal conference and then the 2009 Society for Political Methodology conference.  I read and commented on several versions of this paper and each time it was clear that Dan took the comments he received from fellow graduate students, and faculty here and elsewhere to heart; Dan learns quickly and the various versions of the paper reflected how much Dan matured as a scholar, even over the short time (about 2 years) between the initial draft and the accepted article.  Given Dan’s success with the article he had a smooth prospectus defense and was able to move quickly from the prospectus to drafting additional chapters.  I have not seen anyone make such a seamless transition from courses to dissertation.  Several of Dan’s chapters have been presented at Midwest, Southern, and the Political Methodology Summer Meeting.  It is clear that Dan has a knack for generating ideas and carrying out a research project from start to finish.  Dan is among the most driven people I have come across and is sure to have a highly productive and influential career.

Based on his outstanding achievement in my courses, I asked Dan if he was interested in working with me as a coauthor.  I am happy to report that he said yes.  Dan is the lead on a project in which we are seeking to understand the adoption of various election laws across the states.  We have started with an investigation of absentee and early voting laws but will soon move to voter identification laws.  I believe there is potential for two papers out of this project.  Dan has been extremely active is putting together the original data set needed for this project.  We have had a number of productive discussions about the theoretical framework that have taught me a great deal.

Let me add a bit more about Dan’s performance in Maryland’s Ph.D. program.  Dan passed his minor in Political Methodology comprehensive exam with distinction (our highest grade).  From top to bottom the exam was outstanding and demonstrated a deep understanding of political methodology.  His answer to a question on causal inference was especially strong, representing the best answer I have seen on the 10 Methods exams I have graded in my four years at Maryland.  Dan’s proposal for the conference and his dissertation deal with issues of causal inference and his answer on the exam indicates to me that he is well suited to make a significant impact in this area of research.  

Dan earned an A in MLE was consistently at the top of the class.  In addition to MLE, he has taken advanced courses on causal inference, multilevel modeling, and survey design, earning an A in each course.  Overall, Dan has a 3.9 GPA and is making excellent progress; I have read 4 of his dissertation chapters and have another one on my desk to read.  I have no doubt that his dissertation will be outstanding and will lead to additional publications.  In addition to the Political Behavior piece, he has another article from his dissertation under review.

Dan is also an active participant in our regular American politics workshops.  He consistently offers valuable suggestions to the faculty and graduate students who have presented their work.  It is clear that he not only reads the work carefully, but also takes the time to craft thoughtful and constructive criticisms aimed at pushing the work closer to publication.  When I last presented at the workshop I requested that Dan serve as the graduate student discussant; I knew others would be capable but that he would provide the best set of comments.  As expected, Dan delivered a set of comments that pushed me to improve the work in terms of argumentation and presentation.  He is already an excellent colleague and I look forward to his continued growth in that aspect of his career. 

Simply put, Dan should be invited to the conference.  He is an outstanding student, has a sophisticated understanding of a wide range of methodological tools, an interesting paper on an important topic, and the ability to contribute to the various discussions of research that take place throughout the conference.

Sincerely,

Mike

I got to know him during the year before he entered graduate school, when as an undergraduate he worked with me and James Honaker at UCLA. He helped us develop and coauthor a new version of our (Amelia II) software for imputing missing data. I have also worked with Matt in graduate school at Harvard on the same project, and two others we have started since. In one paper, we generalized our algorithms for missing data to problems of measurement error by casting them as partially missing data. Matt took a major intellectual role in pushing this project forward. 

In graduate school, Matt has shown himself to be one of the rare students who are able to compete at the highest levels in statistics, including a sequence of courses in the Statistics Department, and also in game theory, including courses in the Economics Department. In our department, he is comfortable moving between conversations about American political behavior to comparative political development. Matt is also an accomplished teacher, earning very high ratings from his students as well as a teaching award — and that in the only required course (a methods course) in the Government Department. 

Matt has been collecting skills like some collect stamps. He programmed, in two programming languages new to him, a method we’d worked on for causal inference. He’s also reprogrammed our software for missing data in a more fully object-oriented style. He has shown the same interest in collecting skills in math, statistics, game theory, optimization, and some other areas. 

Matt’s thesis is on causal inference in dynamic settings, as applied to negative campaigning in American politics. I expect this work to be of considerable importance. Although it’s obvious from anyone involved in, or observing, political campaigns that strategy is highly time dependent and extremely interactive between the two campaigns, most statistical analyses assume a single intervention (like the administration of a drug once at the start of a drug trial); this of course is extremely simplistic and misses much of the nature and context of these contests. Changing from one-shot to dynamic causal effects is likely to change many results in most empirical subfields of the discipline. 

Matt has just the right profile to make it at the top of the field in political methodology, or another field of his choosing. I expect big things from him in the near future, and with high probability. (Check this space for updates!)

I strongly support Matt’s application and encourage you to contact me if I can provide any further information.

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Graeme is a comparativist who studies African politics and yet has
received extensive training in quantitative methods (he is currently
serving as a teaching assistant for my graduate methods course).
Graeme and I have written a paper that develops a new set of
statistical methods for analyzing list experiments.  We developed
regression methods (most researchers have been using
difference-in-means methods) and a statistical test for detecting
certain list experiment failures.  We also show how to model certain
departures from the key identification assumption.  We also have
written statistical software to implement all of the proposed methods.
Graeme was an integral part of this methodological project.  We are
also conducting a randomized evaluation of the cash transfer program
in collaboration with the Nigerian government to see if such a program
reduces citizens' support for the militant groups in the oil-rich
Delta region.  We wrote a grant proposal together and received funding
from the U.K. government to conduct surveys.  Finally, in his
dissertation, Graeme analyzes the unique data set about oil discovery
locations in order to test the micro relationship between natural
resources and civil conflict.  In sum, Graeme is a promising
comparative politics scholar who has a unique set of quantitative
methods skills.  His dissertation represents cutting edge
micro-research about civil war, which I am sure will interest many
participants of this conference.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","8771","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","4004","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2011-05-05","2011-05-05","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00

I am very happy to recommend Robert Bond for Polmeth.  Robert was enrolled in my course on social networks and he has worked closely with Jaime Settle on a project to ascertain the social network basis of political trust.  Robert also attends my lab meeting, “The Human Nature Group” and has visited me frequently in office hours.  I suspect he and I will publish more than one paper together in the next 3-4 years as we work together.

Robert is the lead author on a project we have just conducted in conjunction with Facebook that randomly assigned messages to 61 million Facebook users on Election Day in 2010.  I have given him very little guidance and he has managed to learn how to use a set of powerful tools in R that permit statistical analysis of large-scale network data.  The analysis of this data will show that online messages not only influence recipients’ behavior, but also the behavior of close friends as well.  

Robert is also developing an index to automatically classify political speech so that he can use the tremendous Facebook data set to explore the causes and consequences of political communication on a planetary scale.

Robert is a deep thinker, and he is extremely interested in all kinds of social networks.  In particular, I am struck by his story about his former employment at the Peace Corps’ administrative headquarters.  This real world experience fascinated him because his job was at the intersection of two very important communication networks, one from volunteers below offering suggestions and new ideas, and one from politicians above who had to be skilled in the art of bureaucratic competition.  He is very reflective about this experience, and it puts him in a good position to draw on practical experience to help in thinking about Congressional networks and friendship networks of adolescents.  Robert is extraordinarily capable of seeing beyond disciplinary boundaries and thinking about how to arbitrage between political science and sociology, psychology, and other social sciences.

Robert has great intuitions about the theoretical processes that underlie social network behavior and the flow of information between adolescents.  I therefore expect his project will be a success.

In sum, I cannot imagine a young scholar who would be more deserving of support this year than Robert Bond.  His interests and his personality make him an ideal person to benefit from Polmeth.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions about this fine young man.

I have known Bugrahan since he began the Ph.D. program at Madison two and a half years ago.  He has taken a number of classes from me, worked with me as a TA, and is a frequent participant in colloquia, so I know him quite well.  Bugrahan has exceptionally good methodological skills, and would benefit greatly from the opportunity to present his work at the methodology meeting.

Bugrahan has taken more methods -- applied math -- econometrics classes than any student I have ever known.  He has done very well in these classes. (As far as his grades in Econ graduate classes, it is worth noting that the department uses these classes to screen out Ph.D. students.  A B is more than respectable.)

Substantively, Bugrahan is interested in the political economy of international finance.  His proposed paper will examine the extension of voting rights in the IMF, and have implications for other IFIs.  In a very interesting modeling twist, Bugrahan intends to model the extension of voting rights as a Markov process.  While I really don't know whether this approach will in the end pay off, it is intriguing and promising, as well as innovative.  I have no doubts that Bugrahan can pull off this modeling exercise -- and your meeting participants will find it worth their consideration.","Martin","Lisa","Professor of Political Science","University of Wisconsin-Madison","llmartin3@wisc.edu","608-263-2035","received","1641","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-10","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","Vegetarian","","","","","","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

Dear Committee:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Matt Buttice, currently a fifth-year graduate student in our department.  Matt has submitted a proposal to attend the Summer Meetings.  I am very happy to write this letter as Matt is among the top two students with whom I have worked in 17 years of working with graduate students.  (The other student is Alex Mayer who has also applied for the Summer Meetings). 

I have know Matt for about five years.  He has taken several methods seminars from me as well as several additional methods courses taught by Steve Haptonstahl and Kyle Joyce.  Matt served as the year-long teaching assistant for our methodology sequence (including Math camp, and the first three graduate courses in methodology).  Matt’s substantive interests are in American politics, particularly congressional elections.  His proposed research poster entails an extension of some promising work he has been doing on reconciling the issue of bias in expert assessments of congressional candidates’ issue positions and character judgement (used for indicators of candidate valence).  This work began last year with the initial paper being presented at Penn State’s “New Faces in Methodology” conference.  He has continued this work and proposes to present it at the summer meetings.  Given the importance of candidate placement on issue positions and spatial modeling, I think Matt’s research will have wide appeal to both methods and electoral politics scholars. 

Matt would truly benefit from attendance at this meeting and I hope the committee will accept his application.  

Sincerely,

Bradford S. Jones

Tyson  initially became interested in methods while a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M. There, he took the basic sequence, through MLE, as well as an advanced time series class, and ultimately passed their methods comp. At Rochester, Tyson has taken the methods sequence, as well as my course on ""estimating games and testing formal models."" He has also audited other advanced methods courses at Rochester.  Tyson has worked as a research assistant for Kevin Clarke and me.  In one project, Tyson programmed and ran monte carlo experiments for examining ommitted constant bias in selection models.  In another project, Tyson assisted me in course prep for an undergraduate statistics course.  He performed well in both.  Tyson's methods proposal is part of his dissertation.  He is interested in applying ""local logit"" models to international relations data.  These are logit-based extensions of non-parametric local smoothers.  Finally, although I would rank Tyson third, behind Jonathan Olmsted and Brenton Kenkel, Tyson is a strong third.  I would rank him in the 50th percentile of the typical grad student at the summer conference.","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor and Director of the Theory and Statistics Research Lab (the star lab)","University of Rochester","curt.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-3176","received","2354","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor and Director of the Theory and Statistics Research Lab (the star lab)","University of Rochester","curt.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-3176","approved","8085","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2011-05-27","2011-05-27","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","1","1","1","","","","","","","148.5","","","398.50","mc_gross = 398.50

The only student that comes close in mathematical and technical skill is Alex Tahk, and Isa has broader methodological and substantive knowledge.   

Isa's came into our program with strong methods training, particularly in causal inference training from the Harvard stats department.  At Stanford he has completed the PhD econometrics and micro core sequences, and has moved onto topics courses.   He has been the only polisci grad student ever to be part of the Econometrics Faculty/PhD discussion group currently run by Han Hong, which is  by invitation only and run by/for theoretical econometricians.  In terms of teaching methods, he is the most called upon source of peer tutoring in our department, and formally has served as an exceptional TA in our core methods sequence.

Substantively, Isa has already produced oustanding work in political science, coauthoring papers with Jame Robinson at Harvard in comparative politics.  The paper I know best is his analysis of Sierra Leon and Columbia, which combines remarkable depth in historical knowledge, comparative analysis, and methodological nuance.   Although primarily doing substantive work in comparative politics, he also has great depth in the study of American politics, writing his field paper in this field.

In terms of technical skill, methodological depth, and substantive knowledge, Isa has provided an important contribution with his paper on the methods of analyzing causal and equilibrium relationships in dynamic settings.  The clear minded critique of the inappropriateness of g-estimation to the dynamics in politics is very important in the context of research that is currently being undertaken by other.  His development and application of dynamic game to campaign finance is exemplary.

To summarize what I hope is already clear, I give my highest recommendation to Isa.  The Polmeth meetings was designed for a student like Isa, he will contribute in a meaningful way to the group and get much benefit in terms of his development.","Wand","Jonathan","Assistant Professor","Stanford University","wand@stanford.edu","6502699368","received","5961","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","","2011-05-06","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

I am pleased to recommend Olga Chyzh for the 2010 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Chyzh in two of my methods classes (one on limited dependent variables and on statistical computing) and can say that she is one of the most promising graduate students in methods in our department. 

Chyzh stood out from beginning. In my LDV course a year ago, she was the only student out of 6 to receive an A, with the highest scores on both the midterm and final exams. This past fall, she took an advanced methods course from me on statistical computing (Monte Carlo, programming, model interpretation) and again did a very good job. She solidly grasped the material and regularly helped the other students during the computer lab sessions (which was helpful with 13 students in the class). 

The paper that she wrote for this course, and that she has proposed for the conference, uses the multi-parametric Spatial Temporal Autoregressive Regression (m-STAR) model popularized by Franzese and Hays (and various coauthors) to study democratization across the past century and a half. The m-STAR model is particularly helpful here given its ability to begin to sort out interdependence across countries and contemporaneous shocks. Her specific interest here is in the role that international organizations play in creating linkages between countries and promoting democratization among their members. Using the m-STAR model allows Chyzh to distinguish how different types of IOs (centralized, institutionalized, etc.) as well as geographic contiguity influence democratization among their members. In addition to the substantive motivation, I have been impressed by her ability to learn spatial regression techniques on her own and to put together the complicated analysis that this entails (over a hundred countries studied over a hundred years leads to a fairly involved set of spatial weights matrices). In fact, she was having problem estimating the model and found and fixed a mistake in the code for the Stata program she had downloaded. I have been impressed both by her abilities and unwillingness to give up when the data requirements and existing estimation code wasn’t working as expected.

I believe that Chyzh would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. She is one of our most talented methods students and is striking out into the world of advanced methods as called for by her research. She has learned some advanced techniques popularized by members of the methods community and would benefit from the chance to talk with them about her work.

Please let me know if you any questions.

Her fields are methods and political-economy, and she has not decided which of the two she will emphasize in her dissertation and on the job market.  Therefore I think that it is really important for her to attend the methods to make this decision.  Naturally since she is both female and Latina, I am hoping that she decides to focus on being a young methodologist in the field.

Adriana is developing Bayesian hierarchical models for ordered outcomes.  Some of these specifications get reasonably complex, depending on the structures in the hierarchies.  For this poster she will develop a hybrid Gibbs sampler that efficiently produces samples from the marginal densities of the coefficients for these models.  I am impressed with the ambition and the extent of this project, both from a methodological and substantive perspective.

This student is exactly the type of young scholar that we should be encouraging to attend the meeting and give a poster.  She is smart, well-trained, and heading to a research career in quantitative political science. I strongly encourage the committee to fund her application.","Gill","Jeff","Professor/Director","Washington University","jgill@wustl.edu","314-935-9012","received","5287","Gill","Jeff","Professor/Director","Washington University","jgill@wustl.edu","314-935-9012","approved","7501","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-25","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,2

Chris is a very strong graduate student with keen interests in the political psychology, is already experienced in conducting both survey and experimental research and, he has successfully defended his dissertation proposal.  He has taken a good number of serious quantitative, statistical courses, and is working towards a PARISS certificate.  He is very well along in terms of completion of his dissertation.  While he has an NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant under review, so that he will not be starting that aspect of his thesis until funding is secured (it involves an internet survey), he has completed several chapters already, has planned more chapters than are necessary for a strong thesis, and will likely have a complete draft (up to the uncertainty about the NSF proposal) of his thesis by the fall of 2011.  One part of his work involves taking a well-known statistic (well, sort of a statistic) from the psychometric tradition (the scale stat alpha) and giving it  a serious, inferential basis.  That is the subject of his proposal to you.

He started graduate school at Vanderbilt, but with advice from Marc Hetherington, he transferred here, choosing to work with me.  He has been a stellar student, and he “hit the ground running” in terms of research upon coming here.  For example, he is working with Wendy Wood and myself (plus others) on a portion of our project on habit and turnout.  We presented a paper at ISPP based on the results of an experiment we had run.  He has designed and implemented the sequel experiment which is in the field as I write this.

Chris has a well defined problem for his doctoral dissertation.  He is taking the Schwartz values project and applying it to politics, examining its relationship to partisanship, among other aspects.  He has discovered that there is high consensus on what values define partisans, but those who are partisans of the opposite party have different views of the values of their rivals.  This is just a very limited, “tip of the iceberg,” account of his thesis.  He has put together a thesis committee that is both interdisciplinary and drawn from many universities.  This simply signifies the extent of his ambition and desire to attain the very best product he can.  He has some very interesting findings already.  For example, he found that Democrats and Republicans are at least somewhat diverse in terms of the values they hold themselves, but the two partisan groups are very different from each other.  Even more, the values they attribute to supporters of the opposition party are cleaning differentiating the two parties (more cleanly than partisan self reports) and attribute these quite different (but nonetheless mostly positive) values to the other.  This is only the beginning of what is well on the way to becoming a very strong thesis.

	The idea of his Pol Meth proposal can be seen as an integral part of integrating the two disciplinary traditions via the index scaling methods that are encountered in both.  However, the question is of far wider applicability than that, because of the widespread (if not particularly thoughtful) application of the method.  His ability to extend to a serious method will therefore be a specific but widely valued addition.  I encourage you to accept his proposal for the 2011 Meeting.","Aldrich","John","Professor","Duke University","aldrich@duke.edu","(919)660-4346","received","6685","Ward","Michael","Professor","Duke University","mw160@duke.edu","9196604373","approved","1767","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-04","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","I wish to attend the annual meeting this summer because I have heard from many colleagues that it is the best conference at which to get feedback on my research.

Chris was enrolled in my course on social networks two years ago and he has been working closely with sociologist Keith Schnakenberg and myself on a project to apply network theory to the evolution of human rights over time in a variety of countries.  Chris also attends my lab meeting, “The Human Nature Group” and has visited me frequently in office hours.  I suspect he and I will publish several papers together in the next 3-4 years as we work together.

Chris is intensely curious about the complex relationships between human rights.  For example, if a government is willing to abridge the right to protest, how does this affect their willingness to torture?  Chris likes to show this nice quote from 30 years ago that says we will never truly understand human rights (and therefore how to protect them) until we take into account how the violation of one right can reinforce and make more likely the violation of other rights.  A human rights regime is a complex set of rules and institutions, a web of arrangements that is hard to understand without considering the big picture.

For decades, the effort to paint this picture has been primarily qualitative, with normative theorists doing the bulk of the work on human rights.  Quantitative scholars have been more reductionist, taking one piece of the puzzle at a time and searching for statistical insight.  Chris’s ambition is to unify both of these approaches by applying quantitative tools to a whole set of rights.  Fortunately, Chris started graduate school at the right time – in the last ten years there has been a revolution in network science and a massive effort to collect information that is just now allowing us to tackle the complex connections between rights for the very first time.  I am very optimistic about this project.  Chris has already discovered that the protection of women’s rights plays a critical role in the web of interactions between rights, and he is currently looking more closely at detailed histories of several countries to add deep insight to the results borne out by the network models.  The goal is to learn which rights are most critical to target for protection, and also to develop an “early warning detection system” that can be used to monitor current practices in countries at risk for human rights failures.

Chris is a deep thinker, and he is extremely interested in all kinds of networks. For his human rights project, he successfully adapted a complex procedure originally applied to product differentiation that was published in Science. This project really showed how strong his computer and analytic skills are.  In particular, I am struck by Chris’s willingness to cross disciplinary boundaries to do his research, reading widely in physics and economics while also deciding to work with a sociologist on his first paper to come from this project.

In sum, I cannot imagine a young scholar who would be more deserving of support this year than Chris Fariss.  His interests and his personality make him an ideal person to benefit from Polmeth.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions about this fine young man.","Fowler","James","Professor","UCSD","jhfowler@ucsd.edu","858-534-6807","received","8463","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","250","Yes","2011-06-01","2011-06-01","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","vegan","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","148.5","","","398.50","mc_gross = 398.50

I've known Peter for many years.  Prior to entering our Ph.D. program at Caltech, he was an undergraduate student at Caltech.  In the years between his Caltech B.S. and entering our graduate program, Peter worked for a well-known election lawyer in Southern California.  This experience has given Peter an amazingly solid analytical, mathematical, and substantive foundation for his graduate studies in political science at Caltech.

Since entering our graduate program, Peter has become very interested in political methodology and political behavior.  He's an ideal graduate student, as he has all of the mathematical and analytical training of a natural scientist, combined with a passion for politics and a strong understanding of the important theoretical and substantive questions that motive the study of political behavior.  

His early research at Caltech began with a project (with Jonathan Nagler) studying voter registration purges in 2008; some of the preliminary results from that project were presented by Peter in last summer's methods conference.  This project required that the skillfully combine multiple very large databases, and to devise efficient algorithms to estimate complex multivariate models with these large datasets.  This research continues; Peter has a nice substantively-focused paper that should shortly be under review, and he will have a strong paper focused on some of the methodological innovation involved in this analysis later this academic year.

More recently Peter has begun an impressive research project that seeks to integrate emotional reactions into sophisticated models of voting behavior and public opinion.  Some of this research is based on innovative use of novel survey methodologies; for example, Peter has used the 2008 and 2010 CCES to develop and test new survey questions on anxiety (2008) and morality (2010).  He is currently working on interesting papers that test the utility of these new survey measures of both anxiety and morality, and those will make up important components of his dissertation research.

But more fundamentally, Peter has begun a highly innovative experimental research agenda along these same grounds, work that involves a direct collaboration between my research group in political science and Ralph Adolph's biology group here at Caltech.  One component of this set of laboratory experiments involves our efforts to replicate and extend the earlier work of Oxley and Smith, et al., published in Science (2008).  Peter is using a similar physiological approach towards the measurement of subject's reactions to emotional stimuli in political decisionmaking; the initial set of experiments are now complete, and based on these experiments I am confident that Peter will be the lead author in at least two very important papers in coming months.  These experiments involve the collection of vast quantities of physiological data from subjects (their respiration, skin conductance and heart rate information is collected dynamically as they are exposed to stimuli, and respond to these stimuli.  There are quite interesting methodological issues involved in the collection, integration, and analyses of these data --- and I'm also quite confident that in the very near future Peter will produce innovative and influential research regarding the analyses of such data.

In short, Peter is an amazing innovative and interesting young scholar, who has the background and skills to become a major force in some of the new research that is possibly revolutionizing the study of political behavior.  Peter's methodological skills are amazing, as he has the mathematical and programming skills to implement virtually any type of existing estimator, and to work on the development of new estimators.  He has much experience with the manipulation of extremely large datasets, and a very strong substantive background in political science and practical politics.

Finally, Peter has been involved in the editorial production of Political Analysis, he has provided some editorial assistance, and it is quite likely that he will become our primary graduate editorial assistant next year when Ines Levin transitions to her post-doctoral fellowship in September.  Thus, it is quite important professionally for Peter to attend the summer methods conference as his exposure to the important debates and discussions there will help him in his role as future graduate editorial assistant.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you invite Peter Foley to participate in the 2011 summer methods conference.  Peter is an amazing young scholar, and he is going to be an important voice in the future development of methodology and the study of political behavior.  If you have any questions at all, please contact me immediately.  

PS.  If funding is a concern, we will pay the partial or full cost of Peter's attendance at the summer methods conference.","Alvarez","Michael","Professor","Caltech","rma@hss.caltech.edu","626-395-4422","received","2618","Alvarez","Michael","Professor","Caltech","rma@hss.caltech.edu","626-395-4422","approved","6167","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-05","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

Dear Polmeth Conference Selection Committee:

This is a letter of support for Mark Fredrickson. I encourage you to fund Mark's participation at the 2011 Political Methodology Summer Conference.

Mark has improved my own work through his thoughtful and skillful computer programming: he is a co-author now of two packages for the R statistical software system (RItools for randomization inference and optmatch for matching both with Ben Hansen (Dept Statistics, Univ of Michigan) and he wrote an interface to Google Maps to allow survey respondents to draw on those maps (with Cara Wong (Dept of Political Science, Univ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)).

He has also shown wide and deeply considered interests in different substantive areas of American and Comparative politics: he is involved in a project on hate crime and political participation, and project on Black elected officials and the dynamics of turnout in the American South, and is now turning his attention to network affects among legislators and issues of reprepresentation and local and state government. He also recently got excited by Bernard Manin's \emph{Principles of Representative Government} and he is pursuing an MS in statistics even as he excels in our own political science Ph.D. program. I think there are very few political science Ph.D. students who are equally interested in democratic theory, the nitty-gritty of American politics, and statistical computing.

Since leaving graduate school, I have seen many graduate students in their first few years in the political science Ph.D. programs at the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois because I teach them statistics.  I have also informally advised and read and commented on the papers of a few advanced graduate students at Harvard while I was there as a Robert Wood Johnson Post-doctoral Fellow. Mark is by far more grounded (e.g. he knows \emph{what} interests him and has a good sense for \emph{why} that arises directly out of his experience in political campaigns and his experience as a programmer for campaigns and non-profits) and far more skilled in the fundamentals of math and computation as a third year student than any other student in my experience at \emph{any} university in my experience (Berkeley, Michigan, Harvard, Illinois). He is also very ambitious and I expect this ambition to be a positive force enabling him to sustain concentrated effort on substantively important topics with lasting impact.

Mark is an excellent bet for someone who will meld high-tech computing with substantively interesting political science. Since he is just in the middle of his third year of graduate school, he has not yet chosen a particular perspective from which to engage the subxstantive issues motivating his work. I have encouraged him to attend the methodology conference. He shows every sign of becoming a methodologist. I strongly recommend that you give him this chance.

Sincerely,

Students with this sort of background are unusual:  it is more common to find a math major who wants to go into statistics, but without any clear applied goal, or to find a political scientist who wants to learn just enough statistics to solve problems.  In contrast, Yair is positioned to do original research in statistical methodology and also in social science.

During his few years as Ph.D. student here, Yair has done interesting research with several different professors at Columbia (including but not limited to myself).  There are fascinating problems here involving large datasets, experimentation, and complex interactions, and Yair is doing innovative work on the intersection of quantitative methods and real-world political studies.

Nick would be a strong candidate for a graduate student poster.  His dissertation, which involves gerrymandering in the United States, utilizes formal theory, sophisticated statistical analysis of observation data, and simulations. A major part of the dissertation examines how redistricting regimes affect the impact partisan tides.  For instance, Goedert finds that when a partisan tide against a party occurs, it is harmed more in states in which it has engaged in heavily partisan redistricting.  Thus, for instance, a tide against the Republicans harms them more in states in which they have maximized their number of seats than in states in which they have engaged in a bi-partisan negotiation, in states with redistricting commissions, or in which the Democrats engaged in a highly partisan gerrymander. Another substantial part of the dissertation examines how majority-minority districts affect the impact of redistricting regimes.  
I would place the quality and technical sophistication of Goedert's work in the same ballpark as top-level journal publications that have been written on redistricting/gerrymandering.  As such, he would not only benefit from the feedback of faculty at the methods meeting, but would also be able to contribute to others' research.","Canes-Wrone","Brandice","Professor","Princeton","bcwrone@princeton.edu","(609)258-9047","received","1137","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2011-05-31","2011-05-31","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00

I am writing to support the application of Jeff Harden to present a poster at the 2011 Summer Political Methods meeting.  Jeff is a superb student – one of the best methods students I’ve ever worked with and one of the top two or three students overall that I’ve ever worked with.  Jeff is both a top-flight American politics scholar and a very strong applied quantitative methods student.  He has published work or working papers on both methods and substantive issues.  He will be on the market this Fall competing of the best American and methods jobs available.  I highly recommend Jeff without any reservation.

Jeff’s proposed poster focuses on two survey experiments he conducted on state legislators that is part of his dissertation.  Jeff's dissertation examines the supply of and demand for representation in legislative politics.  Jeff correctly notes that representation can take many forms -- he identifies four: policy, service, allocation, and symbolic.  Most studies only look at one, and most studies only look at what representatives provide and not what citizens demand.  Jeff's dissertation addresses these two shortcomings.

In the project for the poster. Jeff examines how institutional arrangements, resources, and attributes of citizens and their demands affect how legislators behave.  The first experiment presents legislators with different hypothetical e-mails from constituents and asks how they would respond.  The e-mails are manipulated to emphasis different components of representation.  The second experiment is a list experiment designed to tap into how legislators feel about descriptive representation.  Both experiments are quite novel.  I think the result will be an excellent poster that attracts a good deal of comment and interest.

Jeff is an excellent student.  He has several papers published and more under review -- both substantive papers and those with a methods focus.  He’s just finishing his fourth year in our program.   He’ll be defending his dissertation this coming year and will certainly be on the market.  He is a great candidate or the methods meeting and will make a very positive contribution.

If you have any questions or require any additional information, please feel free to contact me directly.

Sincerely,

I am writing in strong support of Erin Hartman's application for the 2011 Political Methodology conference.  Erin is one of the most outstanding graduate students I have worked with in the past ten years at Berkeley and at Harvard. And she has a strong background in math, statistics, and computational methods, both as an undergraduate at CalTech and in graduate school. She will be on the job market in the fall, and I think she will be a star. Of the many Berkeley students applying to PolMeth this year, she is by far the best methodologist, and the most important person to invite to present a poster. As you know, the PolMeth Society has pushed to have more women methodologists, and in the case with Erin, she happens to be a women, but she is simply the most promising methodologists I have seen in some time.

I have known Erin for about four years. She has been a research assistant for me since the fall of 2007, was a TA for my graduate causal inference sequence, and she is currently an RA for me. She is obtaining a MA from the Statistics Department here along with her PhD in Political Science.

Erin is currently working on a number of methodological projects, including: (1) developing new methods for conducting balance and placebo tests with the correct null hypothesis---i.e., tests that do not fall victim to the balance test fallacy; (2) developing new methods for determining how far inferences based on a Regression Discontinuity can be extended away from the discontinuity. Substantively, she is currently studying the impact of a series of voter registration laws put in place in the U.S. in the early 1900s. Prior to the end of the nineteenth century, very few states had enacted laws requiring voters to register prior to elections. Over the first two decades of the 20th century, most states implemented a system of voter registration.  The debate over the implementation of registration evolved during this time, resulting in many revisions of these laws throughout the country. This generated a number of natural experiments and discontinuities in the rules of implementation. In the work she will present at PolMeth, she considers three states, New York, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, in order to examine the effects of more or less restrictive voter registration laws on turnout, measurements of fraud, and minority representation. This work is exciting because it combines some important questions in American Political Development and elections with methodological rigour.

Erin's intellectual capacity and methodological training make her one of the most promising young methods scholars in the country.  I recommend Erin Hartman without hesitation. She will be a star.

	Ariel is an unusual—and unusually gifted—graduate student now in his second year in our Ph.D. program.  He did his undergraduate work at Kenyon College, from which he graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in political science and physics.  His physics background is part of what makes him unusual and hints at some of his gifts.  

	What is still more unusual is his combination of interests.  Ariel’s other field, aside from Methodology, is political theory, and Straussian political theory at that.  Political theory à la Hardin or Mansbridge may ally itself naturally enough with statistical methods and empirical research.  Straussian political theory and methodology seem more of an odd coupling.  But Ariel decided early during his first year at UT that he wanted to focus on the fields that interested and gratified him most, and these, he decided, were his two very different loves.      
 
	I first got to know Ariel when he took our second graduate statistics course (in “greater regression”) from me last year, his first in our program.  He was clearly the best student in a class of roughly eighteen, some several of whom were also very good.  I’m not sure I’ve ever had a student who asked as many smart, deeply probing questions—questions that made me aware of previously unnoticed gaps or ambiguities in my lectures.  He caused me on a number of occasions to think harder.

	Both my TA for that course, the redoubtable Mary Slosar, and I immediately considered Ariel the obvious candidate to replace Mary as the instructor of the Government Department’s “math camp” for incoming graduate students.  Though nothing is official yet, I am confident he will be the choice.  Apart from knowing a lot of math, he has a knack for explaining things clearly.  Indeed, both as an undergraduate and at UT, he’s been supplementing his income with some regular math tutoring on the side.

	Early on, Ariel expressed an interest in doing something collaborative, and I happily took him aboard on the paper I’m proposing to present at this summer’s conference.  I’ll let the submitted abstract describe the paper, which involves a mixture of proof, numerical simulations, and empirical illustrations, but let me say that this has been one of my most enjoyable collaborations.  The experience reminded me of my work with the social choice theorist Christian List.  Like Christian, Ariel has a kind of pure intellectualism, an infectious joy in rigorous thought and discovery.  

	Since taking that regression course from me Ariel has taken another methods course or two in our Department from Tse-Min Lin and has now begun taking the graduate econometrics sequence in the Economics Department, in which, I gather, he is doing very well.

 	Ariel has another methods paper underway, though not yet ready to present.  This is a paper with Tse-Min and another of our graduate students, Dorothy Morgan (in whose behalf I am also writing) titled “Variations on the Extended Beta Binomial Distribution.”  It has just been accepted for this fall’s APSA.

	I have no doubt that Ariel will contribute more than the average graduate student attendee to the SPM conference, despite his being a relative newcomer to the field, even it also helps him more than most, acquainting him with more of the possibilities in statistical methods and empirical research.  

        Note that Ariel is applying for funding to attend the conference as my graduate student coauthor and co-presenter, rather than in the more usual graduate student capoacity of poster-presenter.  I trust his will not handicap his application.  He should not miss the conference--and is someone the conference should not miss. I give him my very strongest recommendation.","Luskin","Robert","Associate Professor","University of Texas at Austin","rluskin@mail.utexas.edu","650-380-0430","received","7724","Luskin","Robert","Associate Professor","University of Texas at Austin","rluskin@mail.utexas.edu","650-380-0430","approved","6246","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2011-06-02","2011-06-02","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","148.5","","","398.50","mc_gross = 398.50

I am writing in strong support of John Henderson's application for the 2011 Political Methodology conference. John is one of the best graduate students at Berkeley, and next to Erin Hartman, the most important Berkeley student to invite to give a poster. He is a smart and talented scholar who has a keen eye for research design and for combining methods with deep substantive knowledge.

I have known John for four years in many different capacities. He has been a student in my graduate courses, I'm on his dissertation committee, and he has been a research assistant for me for a couple of summers. I know both his work and his research abilities well.

John is a 5th year Ph.D. candidate whose dissertation is on Congressional campaign communication strategies in light of changing party reputations. More broadly his research interests include: U.S. elections and campaigns, party politics, voting behavior and turnout, and research design and causal inference. Methodologically, he has written a series of papers (one of which is forthcoming in JOP) on the effects of education on political participation. This is a difficult causal question to answer well, and John has spent considerable time and energy engage it.

At PolMeth, John plans to present work entitled ``Hookworm Eradication as an Instrument for Schooling in the American South.'' In 1910, the Rockefeller foundation undertook a public health campaign to eradicate hookworm incidence among children in 11 Southern states. During the intervention, over one million children were examined and nearly 500,000 were treated for infection. John exploits this effort as an instrument to assess whether higher turnout rates are associated with exogenous expansion in secondary and primary school attendance. In particular, he considers two plausibly exogenous interventions (the county infection rate and county exposure to the campaign) as instruments for schooling. He also perform a variety of matching, stratification and sensitivity analyses to strengthen the instruments and to test their validity against possible endogeneity in assignment. He finds a consistent and robust association between increases in schooling rates for 11- to 17-year olds and later increases in rates of presidential turnout for both instruments. The way in which John strengthens the instrument by stratification and matching is methodologically novel.

John combines an all too rare set of skills. He has a deep knowledge of and interest in American politics, a theoretical mind, and strong methodological interests, which skew towards issues of design more than statistics per say. His research proposal engages a ``big question'' in American politics. His work is broad and engages important policy issues with the best scientific methods available in a creative fashion.  In short, I strongly support John's application. Please don't hesitate to contact me for any additional information you may need.

{\bf Daniel W.\ Hill, Jr.} has asked me to write a letter in support of his application for to present a poster at the PolMeth meeting this summer.  I am delighted to do so.  I recruited Danny to join our PhD program, and I have served as his advisor for his 2nd year research paper, his preliminary exams, and now his dissertation.  I am also a co-author with Danny on two research projects (one of which is the poster he plans to present), and as such I am in an excellent position to assess his ability and promise.

Danny has completed his coursework and preliminary exams and
is widely recognized among our faculty as one of, if not the, most promising student working on a dissertation in our program.  He has already published a sole-authored article in {\em JOP}, he is working on two interesting and demanding projects, and defended his dissertation prospectus in spring 2010.  

FSU produces sophisticated consumers of methods, rather than methodologists, but Danny is working at the edge of that distinction.  He completed our five course methods sequence (Math, Game Theory, and three statistics courses) at the top of his cohort, and has read his way into the literature on matching (with Jason Barabas' assistance), 
split-population models, Stata programming, and Monte Carlo 
simulation.  Last summer he attended ICPSR with a Clogg Scholarship and took a Bayesian statistics course as well as Fox's lectures on {\tt R}.   

Danny will be on the market this fall, and has yet to attend the Methods meeting.  My recent PhD students have landed tenure track jobs at Southern Illinois (Joe Young), North Texas (Jackie DeMeritt), and UC, Merced (Courtenay Conrad).  Each of those students expressed at one moment or another that they did not wish to be on the market 
during the same year as Danny.  He is first rate, and I expect to
place him at least as well as these other students.

As I am a co-author on the paper Danny proposes to present during the poster session, and am thus self-interested, I won't extol its virtues.  It is a treatment of the recently proposed Zero-inflated Ordered Probit (ZiOP) model, and we are drafting it as I write (in fact, the draft is presently
in Danny's lap).  The structure of the paper is quite similar to the Split Population Logit paper Jackie DeMerrit recently posted on PolMeth: we review the model, present Monte Carlo simulations, and then implement it in two data sets that have been analyzed using an ordered probit.  Danny, Bumba Mukherjee and myself last week received an R\&R from {\em ISQ} that uses the ZiOP model to study 
whether Amnesty International succumbs to a strategic incentive to exaggerate its claims.  I explain this to make this claim: the paper is part of a body of work, is almost in draft form, and will make a strong poster this summer.  Danny is likely to be the only one of us who attends the meeting, and he has experience presenting papers at conferences, and does well.  

In closing, I strongly endorse Danny's application to present a poster at PolMeth.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I will be more than happy to elaborate.

Kentaro is the best graduate student in political methodology and game theory among the students I have met in the University of Chicago. Kentaro is developing a Markov-switching binary panel model that accounts for country-specific regime changes in the binary panel model using Bayesian methods. What is amazing in his work is that Kentaro is doing model development and programming all by himself. I strongly believe Kentaro's paper and method will be a very important contribution to the study of binary time series cross-sectional data. I have no doubt that Kentaro will be an important figure in our methods community in the near future. The 2011 method meeting will be an important moment for Kentaro to communicate with other methodologists about his work. I appreciate your sincere consideration of Kentaro's application.","Park","Jong Hee","Assistant Professor","University of Chicago","jhp@uchicago.edu","773-702-8056","received","5513","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-12","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

I am writing to recommend Mark Huberty for the 2011 Polmeth poster session. Mark's poster capitalizes on two developing trends of interest to political scientists and methodologists. First, the rise of social media services offers new opportunities to acquire and exploit publically-available microdata on social and political behavior. Second, the rapid development of machine learning techniques provides the possibility of extracting predictive information from this data. Mark's exploitation of new ensemble methods like the Super Learner to generate accurate win/loss predictions based on the linguistic patterns of Twitter feeds for the 2010 Congressional elections shows that the combination of these two trends can yield meaningful information about issues of central interest to political science. This combination of new data sources and novel methods make Mark's poster of interest to political methodologists.

The background to this project should further recommend Mark for inclusion at Polmeth 2011. While Mark's primary research interests lie in comparative European political economy, he has maintained an ongoing interest in political methodology and computational methods during his time at Berkeley. This project originated from his interest in the rapid development of the semantic web and its potential uses, such as Google's influenza prediction algorithms. The lack of access to the Google data in this case pushed Mark to consider the public Twitter data instead, a timely decision given the subsequent importance of Twitter to political events in the Middle East and the United States. Moreover, most of the work for the project was done in parallel with other projects, including work for me on massively parallel computation, as well as his primary research on the political economy of climate change. Mark has also contributed extensively to the department's methods program. He designed, built, and now maintains the department's 18-node compute cluster, which as of its one-year anniversary in early 2011 had processed over 1100 jobs and provided significantly improved compute resources for graduate research. He also designed and taught the department's first course for new graduate students on statistical programming. 

Mark's participation at Polmeth would bring interesting new results for the use of social media by political scientists and provide an excellent opportunity for Mark to expand his interest in political methodology and its applications. I'm happy to recommend him for the poster session and the conference as a whole.

He is a smart and very engaging student who will learn a lot from attending and also add his own intellectual breadth and enthusiasm to the proceedings.

Matt is a student in our joint degree program in social policy, so he has an interdisciplinary perspective and strong substantive interests in inequality and political behavior. His dissertation work, supervised by my colleague Amy Lerman, is on the political consequences of unemployment. As part of that project he has done some very interesting analysis of the impact of unemployment on electoral turnout using data from the Current Population Survey. He has a nice regression discontinuity design (comparing people who became unemployed before the election with people who became unemployed soon after the election), and the preliminary results are surprising and worthy of much more exploration. A July poster deadline would be just the thing to spur that additional work, and the results would be of considerable interest on both substantive and methodological grounds.

I do hope you will be able to find a place for Matt at this year's meeting.","Bartels","Larry","Professor","Princeton University","bartels@princeton.edu","609-258-4794","received","5684","Bartels","Larry","Professor","Princeton University","bartels@princeton.edu","609-258-4794","approved","3421","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2011-05-31","2011-05-31","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00

I am writing as a member of Aya Kachi’s dissertation committee in support of her application to attend the Political Methodology 2011 meeting and to recommend her for NSF support to attend.  I have known Aya as a student in the ITV program, where I am an instructor for students in advanced methodology classes at Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio State, and as a reader of her research papers and dissertation.  

As attested to by the awards and fellowships she has received, Aya is a rising star.  Aya won the Society for Political Methodology Poster Award for her solo work on duration models. In particular, she argued that bargaining duration and the survival of bargained outcomes are correlated because players incorporate their beliefs about the survival of bargained outcomes into their decision-making at the bargaining stage. To address this, she develops an estimator using the bivariate Weibull distribution. Aya also won the Political Networks Conference Poster Award in 2010 for her work with Hays and Franzese on network evolution.  In this work, they point out that spatial association may arise from three importantly distinct processes: common exposure of actors to exogenous external and internal stimuli, interdependence of outcomes/behaviors across actors (contagion), and/or the putative outcomes may affect the variable along which the clustering occurs (selection). Identifying which process is responsible for network generation is a leading question for network scholars.  Kachi and coauthors  move to ensure accurate inference about these processes through development of an empirical strategy that addresses all three. In short, Aya produces high quality, ambitious work on important topics.  Her work is cutting edge.  

Aya is already well known for her work in the areas of spatial models, duration analysis, and network models. She is a coauthor on Hays, Kachi, and Franzese’s 2010 piece in Statistical Methodology.  The piece brings together spatial and endogeneous network modeling and the application focuses on the impact of European Union membership on labor market policies in developed democracies.  She is already making innovative contributions to political methodology and the understanding of comparative politics. 

Aya is distinctive in how she challenges herself with ambitious projects.  Her proposal for the 2011 Political Methodology Meeting investigates how to handle right-censored observations in interdependent duration models by using a copula function and applies the method to the duration of democratic transitions and the survival of established democracies.  Given this is part of her dissertation, it would be particularly helpful for her to attend the 2011 meeting.  Aya is a contributor to the meeting as well.  That is, she engages other presenters by asking questions and providing comments.  

I am very confident in Aya’s ability and am impressed by her creativity.  She has all the early trademarks of an outstanding scholar.

Sincerely,

To cut to the chase, Brenton is one of the smartest students I have met in the last 10 years.  Brenton completed the department's standard methods sequence (probability, linear models, and limited dependent variable models) and hase taken two advanced topics courses (covering topics ranging from causal inference, bootstrap, bayesian inference, nonparametric smoothers, and parallel processing).  He earned an A in every course.  Last summer, I hired Brenton to write an R package for me, implenting various techniques for structural estimation of games.  Brenton's programming skills and efficiency are nothing short of amazing.  The ""games"" package for R is now available on CRAN.  Brenton is currently working on several methodological research projects.  The proposal he submitted for his conference application is part of his dissertation research.  It examines bounds on logit coefficients when outcomes are missing.  Kevin Clarke, Miguel Rueda, and Brenton are still working on their paper concerning misspecification in propensity score matching, which they presented at the methods conference last year and will present at APSA this year.  Finally, Brenton is my coauthor on a project we proposed for the 2011 Methods Conference, where we demonstrate how to use data mining techniques to test formal models.  I cannot recommend Brenton highly enough.  He has a bright future and will be a great addition to the methods community.","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor and Director of the Theory and Statistics Research Lab (the star lab)","University of Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-3176","received","3004","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor and Director of the Theory and Statistics Research Lab (the star lab)","University of Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-3176","approved","1908","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-04","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","Vegetarian","None","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","0","","None","","","Complete",2,1

From: Matthew Lebo, Associate Professor, Stony Brook University.	
I am writing to recommend that Ellen Key be given a slot to attend the 2011 meeting and to present at the graduate student poster session. I have been at Stony Brook for 9 years and I think we have not had a graduate student do this during that time. Ellen is certainly an excellent candidate to do so and her research project (part of her dissertation) will be a very popular poster.
Ellen is an ABD going on the job market this fall. I am supervising her dissertation and it is going to be a hit. The tools of the dissertation are all in time series analysis with special reliance on multivariate GARCH models, dynamic conditional correlations, and ARFIMA methods. Ellen is developing some new tools in the dissertation but it is the subject of the dissertation that will really get people’s attention. Basically, Ellen is showing the effects of politics on the economy. The chapter she would present at Polmeth shows how both presidential approval and the volatility of presidential approval affect personal consumer expenditures (PCE) over the 1978-2008 period. That is, when the president gets more popular, PCE (roughly 70% of the economy) goes up. When opinions about the president are more volatile, it indicates political instability and PCE goes down.
A couple things can highlight this contribution. First, many many economists’ studies have investigated the causes of PCE, but none have looked at the impact of politics. Second, there is also a voluminous literature in political science showing the impact of the economy on politics, but very few papers looking at the relationship in the opposite direction. Ellen’s dissertation has the potential to make an impact on both fields.
Among other issues Ellen’s dissertation will deal with are the web of relationships between media coverage of the economy and politics, the ICS , and both movement and volatility in  presidential approval. Sorting out all the causal ordering and including volatility will lead to a better understanding of what moves both the macro-economy and the macro-polity. Ellen is wading deep into both the economists’ literature on PCE and the political science work on macro-variables of interest (such as DeBoef and Kellstedt 2004; MacKuen, Erikson and Stimson 1992 and many others) and sorting out many of the unexplored and unanswered questions. Ellen's progress is going very well and this chapter should be under review soon. I see Polmeth as being a big step for Ellen in terms of getting her name and research out in the discipline.
In sum, I give Ellen Key my highest recommendation.

I am writing to support the application of Justin Kirkland to present a poster at the 2011 Summer Political Methods meeting.  Justin is an extremely strong student who is doing very well in our program. He began as a more traditional American Politics student, but has since developed substantial interests and skills in statistical methods.  In particular, Justin has become one of the two best students in our program using quantitative network analysis methods.  He's published several papers, including a solo paper in the JOP on networks in state legislatures.  He won an NSF grant for his dissertation and will be a top student on the market this coming year.  Justin is an excellent student and I highly recommend him without reservation.

Justin’s poster will examine the co-sponsorship networks within a state legislative chambers.  His dissertation includes chapters on comparing the impact of single-member and multi-member districts on legislative cosponsorhip, the impact of cosponsorship rates on legislative success, and how the size of legislative bodies and their division into committees affects network formation and density.  His poster will present an extension of this work, most likely focusing on method of measuring network characteristics and method of analyzing networks dynamically.

The analysis of legislative networks has received a good deal of attention recently, but nearly all of that work as focus on Congress and/or been essentially cross-sectional in nature.  Justin’s work addresses both of these points by moving outside of Congress to explore a wider range of institutional arrangements, and his analysis is explicitly dynamic.

Justin will definitely be on the job market this coming Fall.  Given that fact, where he is at on his dissertation, and the really innovative contributions his work makes, I think this is an excellent time for him to attend the Summer Methods meeting.  I think his poster will be very-well received and be a nice contribution to the meeting.

If you have any questions or require any additional information, please feel free to contact me directly.

Sincerely,

He is entering his sixth year in the program and expects to defend his dissertation by Summer 2011. Brad's dissertation focuses on using game theoretic experiments to show how different strategic situations can shape how
voters perceive political disagreement. Since his prospectus defense, most of his time has been devoted to developing different formal models that can be tested in a laboratory environment. This summer, he is conducting experiments that should yield data for two papers of his dissertation.  In the Fall and Winter he will conduct further experiments, and he expects to finish writing in the Spring.

In addition to working on his own dissertation research, Brad has helped to set up and manage the Omnibus Political Science Survey. This is a program that allows graduate students and faculty in the UCSD Political Science department to jointly conduct survey and experimental research.  We currently have about 8 participants from the Department in this program, all of whom are benefitting from Brad’s organizational work.  

Brad is intensely curious about the role of complex relationships in social networks both in the real world and online.  He is one of the most technically sophisticated students I have ever worked with and he is extremely energetic.  Every time he has a new idea he quickly does a ton of analysis.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions about this fine young man.

Ines is one of the most productive graduate students we have seen in political science and methodology at Caltech in time I've been on the faculty.  At this time, Ines has published a paper on the quantitative analysis of election fraud (in the proceedings of USENIX, a computer science organization); and she now has two papers forthcoming (PRQ and the Election Law Journal), both using Bayesian hierarchical models to analyze a unique 2008 state-by-state survey on public opinion and electoral behavior.  

Ines also has a number of other papers in various stages of development, including a solid paper on Latino immigrants, and studies of electoral behavior in Mexico and Uruguay.  These papers all involve the application of sophisticated methodological approaches to the study of important questions, ranging from naturalization to political participation.  She has constructed an impressive research portfolio in just a few short years.

Additionally, Ines has a wonderful dissertation project in the works, developing new methodological approaches to the study of political participation.  Her job market paper, ""Political Participation is More Than Just Resources"", provides an overview of her methodological approach (latent class analysis) and some results that document the utility of this approach to what is one of the most important questions in political behavior.  In the remaining chapters of her dissertation, which will be completed in the late summer of 2011, Ines is applying these methods to other data and I believe that she will have a number of important publications that will come from her dissertation work (articles and perhaps a book).

Ines is highly skilled in Bayesian approaches to the specification and estimation of complex models, typically different types of choice models.  She is moving from being a sophisticated user of this approach to the point where she will soon be a stronger developer of new models.  Ines will be an important contributor to the methodological and substantive literature in her career.

For more than the past year, Ines has been our primary graduate editorial assistant for Political Analysis, and in that capacity she has been exposed to a wide range of manuscripts on all sorts of methodological topics.  I've been very impressed by how this has broadened her methodological understanding, and how much she has learned by her efforts in our editorial office.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you invite Ines Levin to participate in the 2011 summer methodology conference.

I am very happy to recommend Yonatan Lupu for Polmeth.  I have worked closely with Yon for the past three years on a project to assess what causes Supreme Court Justices to invest time in grounding their decisions in prior precedent.  We have based this research on a network analysis of Supreme Court citations and Yon has been instrumental at every stage.  I have seen his quantitative skills skyrocket during this time, and I am very much looking forward to working closely with him in his research on treaties.

Yon is an exceptional writer and a systematic thinker, and he is extremely well versed in both the classic qualitative literature on the Court and the latest quantitative social science.  His decision to leave his law firm has left him extraordinarily focused on pursuing a different kind of life in academia where he is free to focus on ideas.  But this motivation has not disconnected him from the real world.  He is ambitious not only to understand things better than anyone before him has – he also genuinely wants to make a contribution to international cooperation, and I think his work on treaties could do just that.

Yon’s project very nicely sets up a puzzle.  Some scholars argue that countries only sign treaties that require them to do what they already intend to do.  Others argue that treaties actually provide information that helps signatories to coordinate actions with one another.  Both of these main strands in the literature suggest that countries that sign more treaties should be more compliant with the obligations they entail.  Yet, recent empirical evidence shows that the opposite is true!  Why?

Yon hypothesizes a two-stage strategic process.  First, countries that are unlikely to comply with a strongly-enforced treaty will seek out alternative treaties with weak monitoring or enforcement.  Second, weak treaties are more likely to be violated.  To test this explanation of the inverse relationship between treaty violations and the number of treaties signed, Yon will need to construct a quantitative measure of countries’ intention to comply with each treaty and a measure of how much each treaty conforms to the countries’ preferences.  

He has already gathered some preliminary data and developed a multidimensional scaling technique to analyze 300 multilateral treaties included in the United Nations Treaty Collection.  He will soon be able to quantify the strength of the obligations and enforcement and monitoring provisions of each of these treaties.  And this data will go into the public domain, helping other scholars to study these treaties as well.

Yon has great intuitions about the theoretical processes that underlie strategic behavior on the court and at the international level between diplomats.  He is exactly the kind of person you want doing high quality qualitative analysis, but he also has very strong quantitative skills now, too.  And he has been an instrumental part of our multidisciplinary team called the “Human Nature Group.”  His interests span a variety of fields and I think his growth would be accelerated by the Political Networks conference.

In sum, I cannot imagine a young scholar who would be more deserving of support this year than Yonatan Lupu.  His interests and his personality make him an ideal person to benefit from Polmeth.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions about this fine young man.

Sincerely,

Subsequently I worked with him as he prepared for his Methods field exam: he sat in on a topics course I taught in Winter term of 2009, then worked with me through the summer to prepare.  A couple of papers we read about nonparametric identification and estimation with empirical models describing dynamic optimization by agents caught his eye, and he thought to use this to test a spatial game theoretic model of federal agency behavior with some actual empirical data.  He got through his Methods prelim exam with work on that (and last year his poster at the summer methods meeting talked about such work).  Since then his thinking has evolved about the aspects of agency behavior that should examined in light of dynamic optimization ideas.  Such work is the focus of his dissertation (I'm chair of his committee).  The paper he wants to present at the summer meeting (although I think the web site only allows him to specify poster) comes from the heart of his dissertation work.

Relatively recent developments in econometrics have used nested fixed point methods to model empirically dynamic interactions between foresighted actors.  The main advance in the recent models is to allow equibilibrium relationships to be specified with a minimum of parametric assumptions.  Bill uses such models to specify, identify and estimate a new model of relations between Congress and a bureaucratic agency that represents the dynamic and strategic interaction between them, focusing on money from Congress and actions by the agency.  Versions of these models are familiar in economics (specifically in industrial organization), but Bill's model is absolutely unprecedented there.  The whole approach is completely new to political science.  Vital is to note that the models have strategic, forward-looking actors; they do not use any kind of retrospective reaction function.  If these models produce useful results with empirical data, they should open avenues of investigation that can complement the current fixation with empirical models based on spatial analysis of roll call votes.  Budget data are widely available, but tools to analyze such data with sophisticated strategies in mind have been severely limited due mainly to the restrictive assumptions required to apply the models.  Bill's work holds the promise of opening the field to such information.

Bill currently has success recovering the correct parameter values in simulated data generated from known strategic dynamics.  By the time of the summer meeting he should have preliminary results using real data.  He plans to be on the market in the fall.","Mebane","Walter","Professor","University of Michigan","wmebane@umich.edu","607-592-0546","received","4752","Mebane","Walter","Professor","University of Michigan","wmebane@umich.edu","607-592-0546","approved","1444","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2011-05-31","2011-05-31","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","0","I would prefer to do a presentation versus a poster.

Dear Committee:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Alex Mayer, currently a fifth-year graduate student in our department.  Alex has submitted a proposal to attend the Summer Meetings.  I am very happy to write this letter as Alex is among the top two students with whom I have worked in 17 years of working with graduate students.  (The other student is Matt Buttice who has also applied for the Summer Meetings). I have known Alex for about five years during which he took three graduate-level research methods classes, one independent readings class, and has worked on an independent study project. We are in the process of working together on a variety of papers including a paper that will soon be submitted to Political Analysis. The paper we are working on deals with statistical models for ordinal and nonordinal response variables applied to cross-sectional and time-serial data.  Alex has been productive on his own, co-authoring a book chapter with Bob Huckfeldt as well as publishing a solo-authored piece in the Journal of Politics.  In this paper, Alex reanalyzes data from Kam and Palmer’s 2008 JOP piece (which found education attainment had little to do with subsequent political behavior).  He finds that when applying a more realistic matching model, Kam and Palmer’s conclusions do not hold.  He is an extremely careful worker and has an eye for interesting problems, nontrivial puzzles. In a “past academic life,” Alex has amassed a significant research record as a physics and mathematics student including co-authoring an article in Optical Letters.  It is also worth noting that Alex served as a teaching assistant for the MLE 1 and MLE 2 courses at the 2008 ICPSR Summer Methodology Program. 

Alex’s proposed poster for the summer meetings explores the issue of sensitivity analysis and design issues in the implementation of regression discontinuity designs.  Alex has results from three different data sets, all of which have policy-relevant implications for education policy, the area in which Alex is conducting his PhD research work.  This work on regression discontinuity emanates nicely from his JOP paper, a paper that explicitly deals with design issues and causal inference. 

Alex would greatly benefit from attendance at the Political Methodology Meetings. I hope the committee can consider Alex worthy of being an attendee at this meeting and one worthy of receiving travel funds.  He is a friendly, personable student but one who is critical and questioning of methods and models.  In short, he would not be a shrinking violet at these meetings.    

Sincerely,

Bradford S. Jones

Luke is a graduate student in the Department of Statistics with a keen interest in social sciences applications in general and political science in particular. Luke will be on the job market next year, and he would be a wonderful addition to the political methodology community. Luke will be presenting some analytical results of significant applied importance. Such work would greatly add to the PolMeth poster session.

Luke's methodological interests include network methods, and machine learning in natural language processing.  At PolMeth, Luke plans to present work on post-stratification adjustment of treatment effects. These results extend the work of Imai and others on blocking to the case of post-stratification. Experiments often use blocking to improve precision. Another approach often used is post-stratification, which is stratifying the units by some variable after treatment has been assigned, estimating effects within the strata, and averaging appropriately. This approach has some cost when compared to blocking, and potentially some gain when compared to using the simple difference in means estimate for treatment effect. Luke first derive the variances, under the Neyman model, for blocking, post-stratification, and simple difference in means estimators under many possible randomization schemes. This allows for a direct comparison of the estimators in terms of their precisions expressed as functions of parameters of the sample population.

Luke's derivations reveals that, depending on some characteristics of the population, post-stratification is comparable to blocking and is asymptotically as good. It can greatly enhance precision. However, in finite sample situations, post-stratification can substantially hurt precision, especially if the number of strata is large.  

Other participants will learn a lot form Luke as he will learn from them. The kind of work Luke does is not usually well represented at PolMeth, as he will be presenting new analytical results along with applications.  He would be a wonderful addition to the poster session.

I am writing to recommend Jason Morgan for NSF support to attend the 2011 Political Methodology Conference.  I have known and worked with him since he arrived at Ohio State.  Jason is one of the top three graduate students we have ever had at Ohio State University.  His areas are in Methodology and Comparative Politics.  I have encouraged him to participate in the Political Methodology Conference this year and he has a joint poster proposal with Luke Keele to do so.  Jason will be the presenter.   

In the area of methodology, Jason has considerable expertise in event history, time series, and nonparametric methods. One thing that sets Jason apart is his strong programming skills. Jason’s work demonstrates sophisticated methods that are closely linked to the substantive questions that drive his research. 

Jason was awarded and served as a fellow for the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) at Ohio State in 2010-11. Through this position, he served as a consultant to faculty and graduate students about methods and statistical software problems. His breadth of methods training and innovative ideas is what set apart his application for the fellowship. He has also given PRISM presentations on methods topics and software.  They have been very well received by faculty and graduate students in the social sciences.  He was outstanding in this role.  Jason is sought out in the department for his strong programming skills. 		

In sum, Jason is a highly promising and productive researcher at the start of his career.  He has also shown a high level of personal initiative. The elements of Jason’s record provide ample evidence regarding his abilities, drive, and potential to make important scholarly contributions in the future.  When I reflect on the characteristics that have propelled some of our PhDs to be very successful in their academic careers, the common characteristics are ambition, cleverness, and constantly challenging themselves to reach their highest potential. Jason has this rare combination.

Dorothy is a fourth-year student in our Ph.D. program who came to us from Claremont McKenna College, where she graduated summa cum laude and won their Government Department’s best thesis award.  

	Dorothy came to us as a Straussian political theorist, but somewhere along the way, her interests took a methodological turn.  She has done well in her methods courses and is now pursuing a Master’s in Statistics to accompany the Ph.D. she is pursuing from our Department.  She has also served as the TA for three of our Department’s graduate statistics courses.  

	Last semester, Dorothy wrote an excellent term paper concerning the effects of “neighbors’” opinions on political attitudes, where neighborhood is defined as a matter of social, not just geographical proximity.  The methodological content was technically proficient, with some original elements.  The levels of thought, empirical analysis, and, perhaps most unusually, writing were all very high.  Indeed, I’d say that Dorothy is one of the best writers of the something like 125 students in our Ph.D. program—and would be one of the best in any graduate program, not to mention most faculties.     

        Dorothy’s dissertation, a broader exploration of the methods and substantive issues in that paper, concerns the application of “spatial econometrics” to the study of social influence.  She applies methods developed for modeling of geographical proximity to social proximity.  Though essentially methodological, the dissertation also promises to enhance our understanding of important substantive questions about how people come to think as they do about politics.

	Dorothy’s poster proposal also comes out of this dissertation project.  The paper behind the poster compares spatial econometrics with traditional contextual analysis, based for example on multi-level models, as ways of estimating the effects social influence and social context.  Dorothy compares the approaches’ assumptions and payoffs.  This is still work in progress but strikes me as interesting, original, and potentially important.  

	Dorothy also has a couple of other papers in the works, one also closely related to her dissertation research, forms the basis of a poster she is presenting with another of our graduate students, Pete Mohanty at this spring’s Midwest conference.  Further afield, she is collaborating with Tse-Min Lin and her fellow graduate student Ariel Helfer on a paper titled “Variations on the Extended Beta Binomial Distribution,” which has been accepted for this fall’s APSA.  (Both Mohanty and Helfer are also applying for this summer’s SPM conference, and I am also writing in their behalves.)

	I recommend Dorothy strongly for the SPM.  She is an excellent student, who will both add to the conference and benefit from attending it.","Luskin","Robert","Associate Professor","University of Texas at Austin","rluskin@mail.utexas.edu","650-380-0430","received","7190","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-11","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,2

Miwa is a graduate student at Texas A&M University who came here after extensive graduate work in Japan.  She took several courses from me and I am advising her dissertation.  I have worked with many graduate students here and Miwa is one of the very best methodologically and is easily the hardest working.  
	It is important to start my letter for Miwa by pointing out that she is completely deaf.  When she arrived here, she was not fluent in ASL (not surprisingly since the A is for American in ASL).    She struggled in her first few classes here as she figured out ASL and became more familiar with English.  The language problem made her shy and a little unable to fully engage in her classes.  As her mastery of ASL has improved, so has her connection in the classes.  Several summers ago she was in my HLM class and was easily one of the two best students in the class.   While the language difficulties created a problem at first, it is a problem she has mastered.
	As I have gotten to know Miwa better, I am not surprised at what she has been able to overcome.  I have never had a graduate student who works harder or who is more demanding of answers from me.  I mean this in a good way. Some of the times in the HLM class, the material was more complicated than most of the students were prepared for.  For instance, there were some introductory MCMC portions of the class and I gave some advice about choosing the Inverse Wishart distribution for the prior.  I think that most of the students didn’t have a clue what I was talking about.  Miwa quickly understood what the distribution was and what purpose it would serve in the model.  I was surprised, however, when she was in my office later that day wanting to know why it and not one of a few other multivariate distributions would the best choice.  In particular, she wanted to know how to incorporate theory into the choice of priors to improve our estimates.  It was a great insight, after one relatively brief introductory lecture to Bayesian methods and MCMC.  Miwa wants to know the right answer and, more importantly, why it is right and how she can apply it to new situations.  These are the traits that make her an excellent scholar.
	I should also note that her English is excellent.  She does not quite write like someone for whom English was a first language, but she is close.  She has a few issues with the rules of using words such as “the,” but she is also quite aware of these problems and is working hard to improve them.  
	Miwa has an excellent dissertation.  Her research in Japan and here focuses on the separation in people’s attitudes about the different levels of government.  The first paper uses a hierarchical model of trust to uncover the different mechanisms that people use to form trust judgments in the federal and local governments.  The interesting part of the paper is that she argues that the characteristics of the community one resides in, particularly the degree of civic engagement at the city level, shape the link between trust in the two levels of government.  When one lives in a lively and engaged community, the differences between the levels become evident.  In less engaged communities, however, people see the levels of government as more similar and use one summary judgment of both levels.  I think this is a clever insight and one that helps us rethink how people perceive their governments.
	The second paper looks at the over time dynamics in the trust in national and trust in local government and how these respond to different causal forces.  This will be the fist paper that examines the connections between trust in the multiple levels of government.  The insight form this paper stems from the puzzling pattern of results between civic engagement and trust in government.  The patterns of results tend to shift if one looks cross sectionally versus over time.  These types of cross level inference problems are common in the study of public opinion, and usually they are noted merely as examples of the different levels of analysis.  What Miwa is able to do, however, is demonstrate that the patterns exist for a substantively interesting reason:  the intercorrelations between trust in the multiple levels of government.  Civic engagement, she shows, is connected to trust in the local government (not surprising since this is the level where most of the civic engagement occurs).  Once controlling for this pattern, civic engagement doesn’t have much of a direct effect on trust in national government.  
	In conclusion, I think Miwa is well deserving of admittance to the methods meeting.  She is among the most methodologically talented students I have worked with and has an unparalleled work ethic.  She has an interesting question and will only be satisfied with her answers if the methods behind them are exactly the right ones.  She is precisely what one looks for in the graduate student and what I believe you should be looking for to support at the methods meeting.  Lastly, Miwa is a wonderful person.  Her hearing problems make her a little shy at first, but she is a warm and funny person who is a joy to work with.  
	If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at 515-509-6345 or via email at daveamp@iastate.edu

Reference for Richard Nielsen

I’ve known Rich Nielsen since he took my class in advanced statistical methods in the Government Department. Rich is at the top of his cohort, with a strong group. He took my class concurrently with a methods class that normally follows it, and he has subsequently taken a long list of classes in the statistics department. I especially like the paper Rich wrote in my class on causal inference, using matching for time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. The question answered in this paper has been posed repeatedly by researchers for many years in a variety of disciplines and so I suspect the paper will be widely read. Previously, scholars had thought that TSCS matching was basically hopeless, not because of the methods but because of the data. Rich correctly reinterprets the problem and shows that the only real difference between matching in TSCS and standard cross-sectional data is that the the covariates are much richer in the former, as they include the entire past history of each unit. So matching applications without many covariates seem easy to apply but this hides what may be a problem with omitted variable bias. This insight then leads to an approach to TSCS matching that directly generalizes existing methods in a useful way. Rich and I have worked closely together on several matching-related research projects and several consulting projects. We’ve already written two papers together that are getting a lot of attention, and I suspect we will write others. I have seen him work very hard on difficult problems and routinely unearth solutions others had not thought of. He can do all the math that’s needed in whatever problem we study, but his specialty is innovative high level conceptual thinking that is disarmingly simple and powerful. Rich’s dissertation work is on automated text analysis methods for Arabic language documents, including an enormous digital collection of fatwa’s (Islamic rulings) he put together himself. Rich has my strong support and I encourage you to accept his application.

I am pleased to recommend Mark Nieman for the 2010 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Nieman in three of my methods classes and can say that he is currently one our best graduate students in methods. Nieman is in his third year in the program and has taken three courses from me – one on limited dependent variables; one on event history, multilevel, and spatial models; and on statistical computing (Monte Carlo, MLE programming, etc.).

Nieman came to us with a high level of interest in research and political methodology. In fact, he already had an R&R in hand by the time he began my LDV course in his second year. Given his advanced interests and skills, he simultaneously took my event history course, which was timely given that his manuscript utilized an event history model to study globalization and the occurrence of civil wars. He used the material from the class to substantially update the methods in the paper during the revisions, and it is now forthcoming at International Interactions.

This high level of achievement is one of Nieman’s hallmarks and why he is a very promising student. Last fall he passed the qualifying exam in methods and wrote a paper that applied Bayesian change point analysis as developed by Chib (and used recently in political science by Jong Hee Park) to test constructivist and rationalist theories of international relations. I found this particularly impressive since he had to learn the method and its implementation on his own. This is the paper that he has proposed for the conference.

I believe that Nieman’s research would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. He has begun to use and apply methods that are beyond the topics of the faculty here at Iowa and I think it would be particularly helpful for him to have the chance to interact and speak with scholars who are developing those methods. Nieman has the potential to be more than just a skilled user of commonly employed methods and getting exposure to the broader community while his dissertation is still in its formative stages could help push him to the next level of not just being an early adopter, but also a seeker of new methods.

Please let me know if you any questions.

I am pleased to strongly recommend without any reservations Diana Z. O'Brien for the 2011 Summer Methods Meeting.  Diana is a terrific student with very strong methodological skills and training.  She will be on the market next academic year, so to timing is right for her to present some of her dissertation work.  Her substantive training is in comparative politics (with a Western Europe focus) and gender politics.  She is also a very talented methodologist.

Diana's dissertation looks the representation of women in Western European parties.  This is a tricky problem to study because there are a number of factors besides just preferences in the electorate and among political elites.  This includes different electoral systems (with different types of gender quotas), and different strategies parties use to allocate female candidates across constituencies.  Diana has built a number of unique datasets that she can use to unpack these components.

Diana is broadly trained in political methodology.  The area of her deepest expertise is in applied Bayesian methods.  She is using a variety of finite mixture models in her dissertation project.  Her poster would focus on these models and what she learns substantively from them.  Diana knows Bayesian methods and MCMC well; she's not just a BUGS/JAGS user, but is comfortable writing her own code to estimate complex models.  She also is a good teacher.  She was an award-winning teaching assistant for our undergraduate methods course that I taught in Fall 2009, and I expect her to be a regular instructor of methods at the graduate and undergraduate level once she accepts her first faculty position.

Accepting her poster for the summer meeting is simply a no-brainer.

To the awarding committee:

This letter is written in strongest support for Laura Paler’s application for a PolMeth fellowship. In my view Laura is one of the most promising students in comparative politics at Columbia. She mixes extremely strong field research skills and very strong formal empirical and theoretical skills. She has set herself an ambitious research project and has developed a smart research strategy. I am very excited about her project and impatient to see the results of her research. 

She has single handedly implemented a clever field based experiment on political accountability in Indonesia and is presently engaged in analysis. This is a phase where I think she would learn a lot, and contribute much, to participation in the PolMeth summer meetings.

The bottom line: Laura is a first rate student of political economy and is among the best young empirical researchers I have worked with at Columbia. Her project is of great import, and will make a major contribution to debates regarding efficient aid allocation and institutional design for empowering marginalized citizens in developing countries.   

The candidate: I have known Laura in a number of capacities since she entered our program, as student, as a research assistant and now as a colleague. In her second year, my co-PI Jeremy Weinstein and I asked Laura to work with us in developing a research project in Aceh, where, together with the World Bank, we were working on a major project to examine post-conflict reintegration. The project involves an Aceh-wide representative household survey coupled with an ex-combatant survey aimed at uncovering dynamics of the Acehnese war and the effectiveness of post-conflict reintegration strategies. The key empirical strategy here involves fairly sophisticated matching techniques to identify causal effects. Laura’s engagement with this project went much deeper than I expected; she has become an indispensible full member of the team, providing support on technical issues such as sampling and survey design as well as having substantive input into hypotheses development and testing strategies.

As part of this work, I had the privilege of seeing Laura engage in the field in Aceh. Seeing her in one-on-one interviews and in focus group settings, I can attest to her well-developed analytic ability to absorb, interpret, and probe for further information in real time. As part of the research work, Laura demonstrated her exceptional leadership capabilities, training and leading teams of Acehnese researchers piloting the survey instruments and supplementary experimental games. She excelled at this work as well as in her qualitative field research, engaging easily with diverse interlocutors in Banda Aceh and in more rural areas. 

In the course of this work, Laura has developed a real commitment to studying the political economy of Indonesia; she has invested in extensive language training and has been reading widely in the history and culture of the region.  She thus brings an important combination: a sophisticated understanding of political economy theory and deep knowledge of the Indonesian context in which these theories will be examined. 

The Project: Laura has selected a set of research questions that have great theoretical and practical importance and has identified a set of clever empirical strategies by which to answer them. The topics she has selected– how do states develop, how do linkages of accountability form – bear importance not only to researchers in the field of political science, but also to economists and policymakers as well. The approach to these topics that Laura has taken –focusing on the impact of fiscal transparency – is both rigorous and relevant insofar as it provides a tight focus, the possibility for policy recommendations and a (largely) controlled environment for identifying causal effects. 

The core idea of Laura’s project is to work in partnership with Indonesian NGOs that are active on the ground and that engage in public awareness on governance issues with the aim of increasing accountability. Collaborating with these groups to determine which kinds of messages are sent to different constituents, Laura has the ability to generate exogenous variation in the kinds of politically-relevant economic information available to citizens. Estimating the effects of variation of this information, Laura will have the potential to develop a strategy for discriminating between rival political theories of accountability in resource-rich settings, and to  provide information of direct relevance to policymaking on the ground. 

Laura’s carefully selected research site (Blora) allows her to link a field experimental approach (conducted jointly with a local NGO) with real time reforms taking place in a decentralizing, natural resource-rich polity. The location is ideal for Laura in that it provides a natural site to explore her research questions and a familiar locale in which she has already proven research competence. The results from Laura’s experiment are striking and nuanced; she finds evidence that both taxation and transparency mechanisms are at work yet they do not combine in a simple additive manner with implications for where and when to target interventions.

Final remarks. Her project is an elegant example of policy relevant political economy research done well. Careful empirics, close link to theory. It is however just one of a series that are stemming from relations that Laura has been building up with various organizations like the World Bank, USAID and NDI. What is special about her is not only is she a first rate independent researcher, she is also committed to ensuring that her work is of sufficient quality and relevance that it can speak to policy questions. She then goes the extra mile to make sure that her findings are heard by relevant parties. I believe Laura is in a strong position to excel in this work and that supporting her work at this time would be an excellent use of resources.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information about this excellent candidate.

Yours sincerely,

Kelly Rader’s proposal for the summer meeting involves the use of randomization tests in political science, on which she has become a considerable expert.  Randomization  tests typically involve the random scrambling of the key independent variable and then simulating the results up to thousands of times using the scrambled data.  The result is a distribution of  simulated t-tests conditional on the null hypothesis being true. Applying the observed results to this distribution provides an appropriate p-value for the observed results..  This is particularly useful when the proper method for constructing parametric standard errors is uncertain.","Erikson","Robert","Professor","Columbia University","rse14@columbia.edu","212 854 0036","received","6753","Erikson","Robert","Professor","Columbia University","rse14@columbia.edu","212 854 0036","approved","7207","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-26","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

She did well in my quantitative methods courses and wrote an excellent
empirical paper analyzing the relationship between newspaper coverage

To Whom It May Concern:

I am pleased to write in support of Michael Sances’s application to attend the 2011 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. I think that attending the conference this summer would help his career development greatly. I began attending the methods conference after my third year of graduate school and I think that Mike is further along than I was at a comparable stage. He is well deserving of a spot on the program.

I have known Mike for almost three years in both a classroom setting and as a research assistant. Mike is a dedicated and skillful researcher and has received excellent technical training. I am confident that he will be successful in graduate school and beyond. 

Mike is part of a new cohort of graduate students at MIT who study political behavior – something new for us. Though he can be a little quiet and reserved, I think that he may have the most promise among the students I have had a chance to interact with. 

Mike has taken all the methods courses we offer in the department and has also taken courses in the economics department at MIT (no small feat given the rigor of that program). He has done extremely well and, as a result, his training is suburb. I sat on his methods preliminary exam last fall and he performed at a higher level on that exam than any other graduate student I have seen in my 12 years on faculty at Princeton and MIT (including my former student and current colleague Gabe Lenz). 

In my Public Opinion Research Training Lab class, Mike was a leader in designing the survey we fielded a couple years ago. He always brought interesting insights to bear on the topics we discussed and he did a great job of critiquing the items proposed by other students (always in a positive and constructive manner).

In 2009, Mike served as a research assistant on a project that strives to put together a comprehensive archive of public opinion data from the mid-1930s through the mid-1940s. This project involves approximately 450 polls conducted during this period.  Eric Schickler (UC-Berkeley and I received funding from the National Science Foundation to complete the project and Mike performed a variety of tasks, including designing a web interface and completing some difficult recoding tasks. He did a superb job.

For the last six months Mike has served as an RA in my new Political Experiments Research Lab (PERL). His tasks ranged from setting up and programming new packages to complicated experimental design. I rely heavily on Mike’s expertise and I know that I could not survive without his help.  

Mike’s proposed poster on the consequences of post-treatment bias for the study of political behavior is extremely interesting. I think that it will develop into a very nice project over time, especially with the arrival of Teppei Yamamoto at MIT this fall. But by the summer it will certainly be a poster of quality comparable to the best posters I have seen at the methods conference over the years.

In sum, I have no doubt that Mike deserves a place at the methods conference this summer. If you have any other questions about Mike, please feel free to contact me directly at (617) 253-8190.

Sincerely,

She’s not at all shy about it, even if she doesn’t do well at first, but she stays until she’s conquered the problems before her and eventually until no one can match her. 

Maya came to Harvard after getting a law degree and expected to do entirely qualitative work. She was convinced soon after arriving that the only way to get real evidence would be through statistics. And so she built her skills onward and upward and deeper and broader. I saw this in my class in political methodology, where she sat in the front row and frequently asked questions, questions that got better and better over time until she was one of the 2 students I selected the next year to be a teaching fellow. 

This year, we’ve been working together on several projects, from an empirical project on capital punishment, to completely revising the class we taught together, to a study of anchoring vignettes. Maya has been a great collaborator. She’s a great example, not only of someone who has done well in the Government Department, but something of a poster child for the bridge we’ve built between the Government and Statistics Departments over the years. She has deep substantive interests, terrific research skills, and unmatched enthusiasm for research. She also has an enviably broad range of other research projects.

RE:	Recommendation for Matthew Shaffer


To Whom It May Concern:

	I am writing this letter to express my support of Matthew Shaffer, and recommend his application for the 2011 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. I have known Matt for approximately two years, as both a classroom instructor and a member of his dissertation committee. Based on my observations of his research and methodological skills and my experience with PolMeth, I believe that Matt possesses the talents necessary for rigorous quantitative research. Consequently, I whole-heartedly endorse his application.
	Matt is in his fourth year of study at the University of South Carolina and defended his dissertation prospectus approximately one month ago. I have had the privilege of instructing Matt in several graduate courses, including seminars in Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Time-Series Analysis, and an EITM-based course titled Models of Political Institutions. In each seminar, Matt went above and beyond in terms of reading additional material and demonstrating a deep understanding of the information. Based on my evaluation of the doctoral students at the University of South Carolina, Matt is clearly in the top one-percent (I would actually rate him as one of the top three individuals). 
	Matt has applied to the Summer Meeting in order to enhance his dissertation research, “Economic Agreements and Interstate Conflict: Policy Substitution, Coercive Tactics, and Escalation.” In this research, he has already developed a formal model examining the strategic behavior associated with state trade agreements and militarized conflict. Matt’s focus is on expanding our theoretical models (incorporating more nuanced game theoretic models) and developing explicit empirical tests of these models. 
	Given the focus of PolMeth and the opportunities it presents I believe Matt will benefit tremendously. As I mentioned, he is already developing portions of his dissertation. Therefore, presenting these ideas and obtaining critical feedback from PolMeth members will be extremely useful for him. He already possesses sophisticated methodological skills and a keen insight about theoretical development, and the interaction with participants at the Summer Meeting will further develop these aspects.
	In sum, I believe Matt is an excellent candidate for the Summer Meeting and I support his application fully, without reservations of any kind. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I am writing to strongly support Rachel Shorey's participation in the Summer Methods Meeting. Rachel is my graduate student and co-author on our paper submission to the Summer Methods Meeting (""A Class of Bayesian Nonparametric Topic Models for Political Texts"").

Rachel is a 3rd year Ph.D. student in computer science at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her interests lie at the intersection of computer science and political science, where she uses machine learning methods---specifically statistical topic modeling and other Bayesian latent variable models---to understand government policies and politics. To date, her work with me has concentrated on 1) analysis of formerly-classified government documents and 2) analysis of the ways in which House members present their work to constituents. Rachel is an intelligent, articulate, and insightful young researcher. She is extremely inquisitive and quick to draw insightful connections between seemingly disparate concepts. Rachel would benefit greatly from attending the Summer Methods Meeting. Not only will her attendance enable her to make connections, engage in discussions, and learn from political scientists, it will also enable her to introduce cutting-edge ideas from computer science into the political methodology community. Rachel is an excellent presenter. She recently presented her work (with myself and Professor Bruce Desmarais) to an audience of political scientists at Northwestern's Text as Data conference. Her talk was very well-received and sparked numerous discussions. To summarize, I believe Rachel would make an excellent participant in the Summer Methods Meeting. Do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to speak with me further about her.

Dear Committee Member,

It is with great pleasure that I highly recommend Allison Sovey to participate in the 2011 Summer Meeting of the Society of Political Methodology. Allison is in my opinion the most promising graduate student at Yale in any field. She is an extremely smart, hardworking, and talented researcher who has a great deal of potential to be a distinguished scholar in political science. She has already demonstrated a strong capacity to identify important research problems, to develop creative answers to those problems, and to garner substantial evidence to evaluate those answers. I am confident that her future contributions will be many, creative, and compelling. 

Allison is in her fourth year at Yale. I have known her for that entire time in part in my capacity as the former Director of Graduate Studies for the department and in part as she has worked for me as a research assistant. I am currently co-authoring a paper with her and helping to advise her dissertation research. I believe that these interactions as well as her field of study make me well suited to give you an informed recommendation.

While there is much I could write about Allison, I will focus on several points which I would hope will suffice for purposes of participating in the conference.

First, Allison has chosen an exceptional course of study at Yale which makes her better prepared for research  in political methodology than any student from Yale since I started here as an assistant professor ten years ago. She is in the process of completing a joint Ph.D. in political science and economics. While her primary substantive interests are in political science, she decided that she needed the training in formal modeling, methods, and computation that is available in the economics department at Yale. She has done very well in her courses in both departments and has completed all the requirements for the degree except the dissertation. 

Second, Allison has already demonstrated the ability to produce serious papers for publication in major political science journals. She is the first author in a paper with Don Green on the use of instrumental variables that has recently been published in the American Journal of Political Science. This is a terrific accomplishment for a fourth year student and bodes well for her future contributions.

Third, Allison has strong substantive interests in international political economy and has produced a very promising dissertation prospectus. The theoretical model that she is working with relaxes the usual assumption of unified governments in models of trade agreements and incorporates partisan politics and dynamic incentives for governments to sign agreements. Her model develops an insurance motivation for trade agreements that explains several empirical puzzles such as why protectionist parties sign free trade agreements. She is currently working on the model and on various empirical tests of its implications.

The paper that she is proposing for the poster session builds on her previous work on IV estimation. A draft of the paper is already completed and so I can guarantee that she will have a professional and top quality paper ready to present. To summarize, I highly recommend Allison Sovey for participation in the 2011 Summer Meeting of the Society of Political Methodology. If you accept any Yale student, it should be her.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my letter, or if you need any additional information (kenneth.scheve@yale.edu or +1 203 432 6109).

David is currently a graduate student working on his Ph.D. here at Duke, and I am fortunate to be the chair of his thesis committee.  He is now at abd, having defended his dissertation proposal.

David is a gifted student, but he is especially so in methodology, particularly with computer-related skills of special relevance for scaling related problems.  He has an unusually creative mind for this work.  He and I have several projects on going (one with Jacob Montgomery), and the current proposal is one of them -- demonstrating inferential questions that arise in the use of even the most sophisticated scaling procedures.  We are currently looking at the question of the number of dimensions, demonstrating (I believe satisfactorily, but then I would, wouldn't I?)that the observation of estimating what is often referred to as ""one and a half dimensions""in American politics tells us literally nothing about the true dimensionality of the space.  We have other aspects yet to come on this project.

He and I are working on a different project about scaling, that seeks to relate public opinion on politics to more elite opinion.  As a sort of off shoot, we are able to measure the public's growing observation of polarization in a measurable over the last fifty or sixty years, show that this is particularly so with respect to candidates/officeholders and parties in electoral and governing contexts, show that even parties are seen as less polarized in non-electoral settings, and observe dimensions that separate electoral from non-electoral politics in the public's mind, among other aspects.

David has also developed new measures of voting clustering, of what I refer to as ""condition"" in ""conditional party government"" and a variety of related topics.  He has developed approaches that promise more theory relevant analyses of networks than found in this discipline (and in Sociology).  And, I haven't even gotten to his thesis yet.

In short, I give him a very strong and enthusiastic recommendation, and am happy to address any questions you might have.

Sincerely,

The class had about 80 students from around the university, and he was in a very small group at the very top of the class. I chose him to be one of two teaching fellows for the next year’s class. Almost all of those who did as well are now prominent faculty at top universities around the country; I expect he will do as well.

Brandon’s paper in my class is very likely to be published in the near future. He collected about 90 published articles that use some measure of “neighbors” among countries or states and shows that the type of arbitrary decision made in each article leads to highly non-robust results. He shows how the existing adjacency, interpoint distance and graph-based approaches offer different theoretical conceptualizations of neighbors and how almost none of the 90 articles used more than one specification. The assignment was to replicate one article, and he replicated three: all showed the nonrobustness he hypothesized. He then went further toward developing a conceptualization that should enable scholars to make more reliable progress going forward.

Brandon and I have been working together since he took my class on some automated visualization techniques for text analysis work. We hope to be able to provide some computer-assisted methods for those who need to read a large volume of text — everyone from philosophers to qualitative analysts of archival records to those who conduct intensive interviews.

Brandon is positioning himself with a unique and highly valuable set of skills at the intersection of political science, statistics, automated content analysis, visualization, and computer science. The availability of unstructured text is increasing fast: for example, last year, 10 minutes of worldwide email could fill the entire Library of Congress, and this year social media updates have surpassed email. And that of course doesn’t count press releases, legislative floor speeches, and many other official communications by politicians, as well as many others. Political scientists are gradually coming to recognize this mass of information as data; its not in the usual familiar matrix of numbers, but it as or more informative. Brandon is an obvious candidate to help lead this movement.

Brandon is a hard and independent worker. If you support him, I bet you’ll be proud of the result. He has my very strong support. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information.

Alex Theodoridis is ideally suited both to benefit from participating in this gathering and to contribute meaningfully to this PolMeth meeting.  He is a promising PhD candidate in our department with a distinctly methodological bent, and I am happy to recommend him and his research without any reservation whatsoever. He is currently in the process of completing his doctoral research and will be on the job market in the fall. 

It is from that doctoral research that his poster proposal emerges.  His thesis is focused on improving our understanding of partisan identification and the ways in which it operates as a social identity.  His work speaks to both the persistence of this attachment and the practical implications of it, especially with regard to perceptual bias and motivated cognition.  He has effectively tackled this topic, incorporating theory and methods from political science, statistics and psychology.  In particular, he has developed a specialization in the techniques of survey experimentation and in the statistical analysis required to analyze the resultant data. His poster submission promises to advance our ability to effectively measure partisan identification.  The data from the set of survey experiments show partisan bias in settings not previously studied.  These findings are stronger than one might expect and provide an important contribution in and of themselves.  Alex uses these results to systematically assess the predictive value of various measures of partisan intensity.  In particular, this poster focuses on a measure of identity fusion (a concept that has recently emerged from social psychology) and an implicit measure of attachment.  With regard to the latter, Alex and I are both skeptical of the more common applications of the Implicit Association Test.  The method has been most famously used to measure implicit racial bias.  This application is very different from the one Alex employs in his research.  The IAT as Alex uses it avoids many of the problematic interpretation issues associated with the other valenced applications.  In Alex's research, the IAT is used solely as a measure of cognitive association between the subject's concept of self and a partisan target (Democrat/Republican).  This sort of cognitive proximity is at the heart of any identity based story of bias and motivation.  And, Alex has chosen the most direct available way of isolating it.  The use of response latency for this sort of measurement is well established, but its application to party identity is novel and, I believe, represents an important advancement.  In addition to this, the research Alex proposes to present in his poster helps determine the extent to which partisan identity in the United States can be described as fused.  This is an important topic, because identity fusion is associated with increased bias and extremism in both thinking and action. 

I first came to know Alex through his participation in Berkeley's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program (IGERT).  This program is funded by the National Science Foundation and provides generous fellowships and advanced methodological training to a select group of doctoral students from across Berkeley's social and behavioral science departments.  Alex is one of two IGERT fellows in his political science cohort and one of only seven selected that year at Berkeley overall. My course, The Statistics of Causal Inference in the Social Sciences, is offered as part of the IGERT curriculum. Alex quickly emerged as one of the star students in this challenging class, consistently demonstrating the ability to grasp and apply the advanced methods I covered.  

For that class, he wrote an outstanding paper which employs matching to improve upon a quasi-experimental study conducted to assess a national civic education program.  He has extended this analysis such that his findings both improve upon those produced by other, less rigorous analyses of these data and contribute to our general understanding of the ways in which civic education does and does not impact political attitudes and knowledge among students. Some of this work has been presented at PolMeth in the past. 

Alex has also worked with Henry Brady on a project that involves the exploitation of a natural experiment to estimate the various factors in a voter's decision to vote or abstain.  The analysis that Alex has conducted involved working with an extremely large dataset.  Through manipulations of the code for my GenMatch package, Alex was able to generate a matched sample from the raw data.  Then, despite the fact that the matched sample contained more than 1 billion observations, Alex was able to write a program to produce estimates, conduct tests of statistical significance and generate other values of interest.  This programming required a great deal of efficiency, despite the fact that Alex secured access to a machine in our Department of Statistics with 32 GB of memory.  Alex's knowledge of statistics and scientific computing were not only demonstrated by this project, but they were also significantly expanded.  And, his experience analyzing such large datasets will become more and more valuable as the amount of data we must manipulate in social science continues to increase.  

Driven by his substantive interests, Alex has shown a great deal of commitment to mastering statistical and formal methods. He brings to this research both a substantive mastery of his subject matter and a commitment to apply the most appropriate methods available to his inquiry.  Alex is a promising young scholars, and I strongly encourage you to accept his poster proposal for the Summer Meeting.

Andrew is
a 5th year PhD student at NYU.  He has worked with me on several
projects already, and he is one of the smartest graduate students I've
worked with. He is writing a dissertation on the strategies candidates
use in choosing which issues to emphasize. He has accepted a postdoc
at Vanderbilt's Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions
beginning Fall 2011. Andrew is headed to a very successful career.

Andrew's proposed poster for methods is a very clever attempt
to deal with a tricky measurement error problem. In a survey
that is a rolling cross section the measurement error will not
be random, but will vary systematically over time. And it will
vary in a toxic manner - being correlated with a variable of
key interest. Andrew deals with this by estimating time-one
variable of interest (one can think of this as a missing
data type approach).  What is impressive is that he is able
to show via simulation that his method works very well, and
better than available textbook suggestions. I think this will
be an excellent poster, and I strongly reccomend that Andrew
be invited to present his work.

In Andrew's dissertation he is both trying to explain why candidates
choose they issues they do to emphasize in their campaigns, and he is
proposing a much needed refinement to the ``issue ownership''
literature.  That literature looks at candidate behavior based on
which issues voters perceive some parties to be ``better'' at.  As
such, it is often devoid of any issue-based spatial component. And, it
suggests that candidates should always be talking about different
issues in their camapigns - though we observe that in fact candidates
are almost always talking about exactly the same issues.  It is this
paradox that is one of the things Andrew seeks to resolved.

By carefully specifying a model to include multiple issue based
measures, Andrew brings into this literature a spatial issue
component.  And in research Andrew has already completed, by including
a question wording experiment on the 2008 Cooperative Congressional
Election Study, he was able to show that what was previously thought
to be voters believing some parties were more  competent on
issues, were really likely just cases of voters preferring some
parties'  positions on issues.


In the first paper of Andrew's dissertation he tests the effects of
campaign ads on: 1) informing voters; 2) persuading voters to change
their issue positions; 3) priming voters on the salience of issues;
and 4) influencing actual vote-choice.  This is a really nice paper
using the panel component of the Annenberg survey. Andrew combines
this with advertising data from the Wisconsin Advertising project (the
CMAG data). He is thus able observe respondents at two time periods,
and to have a measure of what advertisements they were exposed
to in between the two observations. This obviously lets him surmount
many of the endogeneity issues plaguing studies of the effects of
advertising. While the Anneberg data and CMAG data have both been
available for awhile, I think Andrew's use of them is the most
effective to date on estimating the effect of advertisements.  And by
having a comprehensive set of hypotheses for the different effects
that could be attributed to advertisments, he really pushes forward
what we know here.

This paper sets the stage for the next chapters of Andrew's
dissertation where he develops a model of voting that allows
for position and valence effects.

The project has great potential to advance what we know about
campaigns. By using Senate candidates, where there are many
competitive races, Andrew can observe how candidates react to one
another and test a much richer set of hypotheses about campaign
behavior than if merely looking one campaign where there is no
variance on the context or behavior of opposing candidates. For
instance, he has the obvious advantage of being able to see what
candidates say on issues where they fit their constituency well, and
where they do not. I think this kind of work follows nicely on recent
work by Vavreck ({\it The Message Matters}, Princeton, 2009) showing
that effective campaign strategy can be determined by context.

And Andrew is also working with me on a paper on the effect of
negative campaign spending on turnout. We develop a model
that can distinguish when we would expect negative campaign
spending to increase turnout, and when we would expect it
to decrease turnout. We believe we will be able to thus
reconcile the tremendous amount of conflicting results in
the literature on the effect of negative campaign spending
on turnout.

Again, I highly reccomend that you invite Andrew to the Methods
Conference. I think he would be presenting a very high quality
poster.


poster.

Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions or would
like further information.

Sincerely

Carlos has taken two quantitative methods courses from me and was
clearly the best student among about twenty students of his cohort.
He is currently enrolled in Xun Pang's Bayesian methods course and at
the same time finishing up the formal theory sequence.  The paper
Carlos is planning to present uses the mixture modeling to test the
formal model he developed for the monetary policy using the original
data set.  It is a nice ``EITM'' research project.  In addition,
Carlos and I are working together with Gary King on a joint project
where we evaluate the causal effect of Seguro Popular (the Mexican
universal health care program) on election outcomes by taking
advantage of the randomized evaluation of Seguro Popular.  Throughout
this project, Carlos has learned how to use GIS software and perform
basic spatial statistical analyses.  In conclusion, Carlos is a
promising graduate student who I predict will become a leading scholar
of comparative political economy with an impressive set of technical
expertise in formal theory and quantitative methods.  I urge the
program committee to give him an opportunity to present his research
at the political methodology conference poster session.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","6732","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","4380","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2011-05-07","0000-00-00","","","","","2011-05-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

I'm writing to recommend Frances Zlotnick for the conference.  She is a co-author on the paper I plan to present at the conference, along with two other collaborators (Hanna Wallach and Rachel Shorey).  Frannie has offered independent contributions to the project and has been an indispensable part of our research team.  She certainly deserves to attend, given her contribution to the paper.    

As she is only a first year, she won't be presenting a poster.  Nor will she need funding for the conference (Stanford will cover her travel).  But it'd be great for someone as talented as Frannie to see the methods conference, how our work is received, and to learn more about the topics of interest at methods conferences.

Thank you for considering her
