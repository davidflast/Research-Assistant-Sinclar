Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Scott is a comparativist who has a great empirical dissertation
project.  Scott has already won the best poster award from the last
year's political methodology summer meeting and will be on the job
market this fall.  I expect that he will have lots of offers given his
unique combination of quantitative skills and creativity on the
substantive side.  For his dissertation project, Scott basically
digitized historical maps of Europe for several centuries and is now
conducting a statistical analysis examining how the size of states
changes over the course of several hundred years.  As I understand it,
the existing literature has many interesting theories that are not
being rigorously tested.  Scott actually shows that many of these
theories do not find empirical support in his data and develop an
alternative account of how the size of states shrinks and expands
depending on the external environment and its resulting incentives.
In terms of his methodological training, Scott was someone who came to
Princeton's Ph.D. program with very little mathematical background.
However, Scott is one of the hardest working graduate students I've
seen and has improved his technical skills over the course of his
graduate studies.  Now, he is using all these skills to interesting
substantive problems where many of his research projects involve
innovative natural experiments to answer important historical
questions (like James Robinson).  Together with Marc Ratkovic, Scott
and I are working on a methodological paper that shows how to
extrapolate experimental and instrumental variables to a target
population.  Given that we have finished all the analytical and
computational work, I expect that we will have a complete working
paper in a few months.  In conclusion, Scott is a substantive
researcher who is eager to learn new methods and apply them to
substantive research in a clever way.  I think he will benefit from
attending the methods conference - learning cutting edge methods and
interacting with methodologists.  At the same time, I also think many
of attendees will benefit from Scott; they will find his project quite
amazing in terms of its scientific significance and scope.","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","6588","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","1999","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-06-03","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

I write to recommend Brice Acree, an applicant to attend the POLMETH summer meetings. Brice, a first year student (but admitted with a MA), is sophisticated in political methodology well beyond his years. He had already taken most of our required methods courses and so has moved directly to the most advanced level. (He is in my time series seminar this semester.)

Brice has done collaborative papers with my colleague (and POLMETH regular) Justin Gross. Justin and Brice are working on analytic methods for automated text analysis systems. I have encouraged him to continue that collaboration and also to continue to build depth in content analysis. He is doing hard core stuff at the outset, so there is no limit to what he may be able to accomplish with greater experience.

Brice will probably choose to be one of our handful of methods majors, an increasing trend here at UNC, following years of methods recruitment. We are pushing people, and they are pushing themselves, to level much higher than we had ever attained in the past.

In sum, I very strongly recommend Brice Acree.

He is currently the senior Rochester methods student applying to attend the conference and will be on the market this fall.  

I have known Jeff for six years.  He has taken my courses and served as my teaching assistant.  Jeff is not an IR scholar who does a little methods.  He is a methodologist.  Indeed, Jeff passed our more difficult methods comprehensive exam, which involved defending a paper that makes a methodological contribution.  That paper, ""Pricing the Costly Lottery,"" uses Bayesian MCMC and financial instruments during the US Civil War to estimate beliefs by both sides about the expected outcome and remaining duration of the war.  It's a really interesting paper, which I believe he has presented as a poster at a prior summer methods conference. The paper is also part of his dissertation _Quantifying War_, for which I am an adviser.  

Jeff's summer methods proposal is to use a Bayesian variable selection technique to model temporal breaks/change points in models of conflict.  This is an interesting project that, in some ways, marries existing work on change points (e.g., by Spirling and Blackwell) with work on Bayesian priors for variable selection (e.g., spike/slab models by Gill & Pang).  I have recently developed interests in both change points and variable selection, so I am looking forward to seeing this paper develop further.
 
What else can I say about Jeff?  He is currently a fellow at Cliff Carrubba's QuanTM Institute.  He won a graduate teaching award here at Rochester and would have won it a second time for his work as my TA for an undergraduate course in statistics.  Unfortunately, our faculty do not like to award it twice.  Finally, he has already contributed to the statistics field with an R package, ggthemes, which provides different themes for ggplots.

Jeff would be an excellent addition to the summer methods meeting.  He is at the top of my list for the Rochester applicants.","Signorino","Curt","Assoc Prof","Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-273-4760","received","3382","Signorino","Curt","Assoc Prof","Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-273-4760","approved","7971","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-06-03","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

This is a letter in support of Pablo Barbera's application to attend
the 2013 Summer Methodology paper, and present a poster  (``Birds of the
Same Feather Tweet Together, Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using
Twitter Data'').  

Pablo is a third year PhD student in the Politics Departmen at NYU. I have known
Pablo for two  years, and I serve as the co-chair of his dissertation
committee.  ALong with the standard 3 semester quantitative methods
sequence we offer in-house; Pablo has taken courses on experimental
methods, and gone outside the department for more econometrics (Bill
Greene), and courses on Causal Inference (Hill) and Bayesian Analysis (Gelman).
So he is well tooled up.

Pablo is interested in the impact of social media on political
behavior.  Pablo recently defended his paper, ``Birds of the Same
Feather Tweet Together, Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter
Data'' to his committee.  This is a really excellent paper, that
combines really clever insights and empirical tests. Pablo develops a
model to estimate the ideology of users on Twitter based on who they
choose to follow.  By assuming that people follow people with similar
beliefs Pablos is able estimate an ideal point for all users who
report following a minimum number of political figures.  The Bayesian
estimation is based on an IRT model that has become commonly used in
political science for estimating ideal points, but I have never seen
it used in this context.  Pablo treats ideology as a latent variable,
and allows different users on twitter to have different levels of
popularity.  And the estimation is very carefully done.

Of course estimating an ideal point for a few hundred thousand twitter
users, and showing the estimated ideal points have meaning, are
different things. Thus Pablo tests the estimates for validity in
several ways.  He is able to match a sample of the users to stated
party identification by using the publicly available Ohio State Voter
File. And he is able to group the ideology estimates based on stated
political predispositions in the sample's Twitter Profiles.  He also
plots estimated ideology against age and home value when that is
possible to identify. And, using data from the UK, Spain and the
Netherlands, he plots estimates of party positions against the party
platform estimates of Benoit and Laver. Finally, he also compares the
estimated ideal points for House and Senate members in the United
States against their Nominate scores.

The totality of the relationships provides very convincing evidence
that Pablo is really estimating ideology.  This paper has already
gotten a fair bit of notice. The method has been replicated by people
using data in other countries. This is one of the best papers I've
ever gotten from a PhD student.  And I expect it to be published in a
quality journal in political science.


Pablo is working with an interdisciplinary group of faculty
(representing Political Science, Psychology, and Computer Science) on
a project to look at the impact of social media on political
behavior. Being able to attend the Political Methodology Conference
would be a big help to him.  And, as I have said, would allow him to
present very high quality work there.  He is not proposing vapor-ware
or a project that he is just getting started on. Pablo has a novel
methodological technique (the combination of an ideal point model with
social media data), and very interesting results from it that he has
already testsed against known quantities.

I give Pablo my highest recommendation.  He is on his way to writing
an outstanding dissertation.  I hope you can invite him to the meeting.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like additional

This project is an offshoot of the extensive work that Bagozzi and Beieler have been doing with Monroe as part of the new Penn State ""Big Data in the Social Sciences"" project which started in August 2012. This will be a summary of a variety of methods that they have developed in the first year of the project, and I am confident that it will be both methodologically sophisticated and of interest to a variety of people attending the meeting. 


Endorsement of the individual: 

John has been working with me for the past year on developing web-scraping and semi-automated coding routines for coding near-real time data on mass killings of noncombatants based on news reports, and he is also currently enrolled in my graduate event data analysis course. He has an excellent grasp of the issues and techniques relevant to contemporary political analysis, and is far more advanced than most students in terms of his ability to implement these in both conventional and distributed computing environments. I am completely confident that he, along with his coauthors, will be able to pull off this poster and give a professional presentation of it at the summer meetiong. If I can provide any additional information, please feel free to contact me.","Schrodt","Philip","Professor","Pennsylvania State University","schrodt@psu.edu","814-863-8978","received","2965","Boob","Kristy","Graduate Staff Coordinator","Penn State University","kmc248@psu.edu","814-863-1595","approved","2717","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-05-30","2013-05-30","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","1","1","","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","102","","","352.00","mc_gross = 352.00

He has proposed to present a regression discontinuity analysis to test how nationalistic surges affect state aggression.  He took advantage of the fact that many countries experience a boost in nationalism when they attend the World Cup and qualification for the World Cup. He demonstrates that qualification for the World Cup is suitable for analysis by RD. He compared the group of countries that barely qualified to the group that barely missed it, and he found that the group that barely qualified experienced a large spike in aggression levels starting the World Cup year.  After observing this result, he replicated the analysis using the FIFA regional soccer championships and found a similar effect. The results are statistically significant in both datasets separately, and they attest to the role that nationalism can play in fueling interstate conflict.

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Graeme will be the star in the comparative politics job market this
fall.  He is a comparativist who studies African politics and yet has
received extensive training in quantitative methods.  Graeme has
served as a teaching assistant for my advanced graduate methods
course, has already published a political analysis paper on list
experiments with me (and its accompanying software), and has
coauthored another methdological paper with me which is R&R at AJPS.
In addition, our application paper is forthcoming in APSR and has won
the best paper award from MPSA.  Together with these publications, his
dissertation, which is about natural resources and conflicts, is quite
impressive.  Graeme has gathered an original data set about the
location and timing of oil discoveries over last several decades in
Nigeria and is examining how they influence the onset of local
conflicts.  His empirical findings reverse many of the existing
theories: it turns out that the discovery of oil reduces the
likelihood of conflict in that region but increases it outside of the
area.  Graeme has a neat theory to explain this and other
counter-intuitive findings.  He is also conducting survey experiments
in Nigeria, which are funded by the grants from the UK government and
the NSF dissertation improvement grant.  In sum, Graeme is a very
promising comparativist with methodological skills that parallel with
those of many young methodologists.  Given that comparativists are
increasingly using experiments and other methodologically
sophisticated techniques, the methodology society will need someone
Graeme who can bridge between political methodology and the
substantive subfield.  He has my strongest support and I strongly
encourage the selection committee to give him an opportunity to
present his work at the summer meeting.","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","7833","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","6907","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-03","2013-06-03","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","1","1","1","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

Rob is a smart, creative, and quite personable young scholar.  

I have seen a previous version of the paper that Rob is proposing for the methods conference and I like it very much.  Rob develops a technique similar to Statistical Backwards Induction (Bas, Signorino, & Walker 2008), but one that allows for games with numerous potential players, such as one might encounter in IR.  Rob terms his technique ""nSBI"".  I should note that it's more than a simple extension of our SBI method.  It requires that each decision maker consider the potential actions (e.g., intervention) of numerous other players.  In some sense, it is a partial equilibrium representation of the problem, but one I find plausible.  To implement it, Rob developed a multinomial auto-logistic version of Ward & Gleditsch's (2002) binary auto-logistic MCMC model.  Applied to Fearon & Laitin's data for civil war, Rob finds that potential major power intervention has a significant effect on rebel behavior.  Rob's paper is a great idea that required some heavy lifting, uses just the right amount of statistical (and computing) firepower, and then produces interesting but reasonable results.

Rob has been the TA for my graduate statistics course on maximum likelihood estimation (plus a few other topics).  This particular class was the largest I have taught at the graduate level (at least, for a semester-long course).  While I usually have 1-3 PhD students from our business school, it appears that some departments there have now made my course a requirement.  Rob was faced with twice the normal number of grad students (19).  Not only did he handle it with aplomb, but we received some of the highest course evaluations in over ten years, and Rob's evaluations were absolutely stellar.  I suspect this is due in no small part to his having served as a teaching assistant each year since 2009 at ICPSR. Rob is very comfortable with statistics and knows how to communicate it well.

Finally, Rob is a likeable guy and a leader among his peers.  He would be an absolutely excellent addition to the summer conference.","Signorino","Curt","Assoc Prof","Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-273-4760","received","4867","Signorino","Curt","Assoc Prof","Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-273-4760","approved","5414","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-03","2013-06-03","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MX","","","","","","","","204","","","454.00","mc_gross = 454.00

Evaluation For: Olga Chyzh
Recommender: Frederick J. Boehmke

Dear Selection Committee Member,

I am pleased to write this letter in support of Olga Chyzh’s application for the 2013 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Chyzh in two of my methods classes and am currently co-advising her dissertation. I would place her among the top 2 or 3 graduate students in methods in our department over the last 10 years. 

In addition to doing excellent work in classes she took with me, Chyzh has been hard at work wrapping up what will likely be an excellent dissertation. It focuses on international connectedness between countries by applying social network analysis to interstate relations with the goal of not just measuring characteristics of international networks, but of simultaneously modeling the process through which they emerge in conjunction with various outcomes of interest such as democratization or improving domestic human rights. Chyzh adapts game-theoretic network models from economics to her purpose and derives a number of theoretical results which she tests with a coevolution model of network behavior and outcome (as in Snijders). She presented a poster based on this work at last year’s meeting and it was among the top 3 posters presented, at least as evaluated by the best poster committee (which I chaired and am therefore privy to this unoffical information).

Chyzh will present a poster this year based on a paper that we are coauthoring that explores the issue of endogeneity in measures of relative positional similarity, such as S scores or SEq scores. We discuss the potential for endogeneity in such measures in general, but also within an explicitly spatial or network framework and conduct Monte Carlo to evaluate its consequences for these two examples. We propose an instrumental variables approach that appears to eliminate endogeneity bias. Chyzh has done much of the work on this paper and I believe it will be of interest both to applied researchers, but also to methodologists given the nonstandard form of endogeneity (i.e., the endogeneity arises from the variables used to construct the measure included in the model of interest rather than directly in the measure itself).

Chyzh would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting again, but I also think that she will be an asset to the meeting. Attending in the past, combined with participation in summer methods training programs and regional methods meetings has helped her mature into one of the better methods graduate students attending the meeting. She is capable of contributing both through her own work, but also through her interactions with others.

Please let me know if you any questions.","Boehmke","Frederick","Associate Professor","University of Iowa","frederick-boehmke@uiowa.edu","319-335-2342","received","4877","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-13","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","WS","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

ELIZABETH COGGINS:

I write to recommend Elizabeth Coggins, who will be an applicant for the POLMETH summer meetings. I have worked closely with Elizabeth, probably more than any student I have supervised over the span of forty-plus years. She was my research assistant in her first year. We began to work collaboratively in her second. In this last two years she has been the project assistant---and really the heart of a collaborative NSF grant (with Frank Baumgartner) in a proposal that budgeted nothing for faculty time. I am now supervising her dissertation and continuing to collaborate on related issues. I know her very well.

Elizabeth is in transition this summer, finishing her dissertation in the Spring and getting ready to join Andrew Martin on a post-doc in the Fall.

Elizabeth Coggins is a terrific young scholar, among the handful of best students I have worked with over the years. Her work, like my own, is strongly focused on public opinion with a longitudinal orientation. She has already produced several papers intended for publication and there will be a torrent more to come. She is at ease with methods of all sorts, but I think her work will focus more on substance than method. I have been wrong in that assertion about other students, so take it with suitable modesty. She also has supporting strength in institutions, specifically the Supreme Court, from earlier in her career. But she has clearly chosen a public opinion track for the dissertation and work beyond it.

I am working with Elizabeth in parallel, with articles already out for review at journals and the expectation of more to come. Although betting on journals is always hazardous, I would expect at least two of those to be accepted for publication before Elizabeth begins a new position. She also has papers in progress, both single  authored and collaborative, which are pre-dissertation. 


Elizabeth's dissertation is a study of the modern evolution of the connotation of liberalism in the United States. We know that at a particular time in the late 1960s liberalism, in the minds of ordinary Americans, went from a scarcely understood philosophical position to being a pejorative set of images racial disorder, counterculture, and strident opposition to American foreign policy. Its symbol of the ``common man'' of the Roosevelt through Kennedy years was replaced by much less sympathetic figures, the angry welfare mother and rioting students. In a brief period of time liberalism became a kind of tarball that endangered all who touched it.

We have not learned much about these things because of two theory and research problems. One is that we invariably treat liberalism and conservatism as polar opposites, deriving meaning from opposition. We know from 50 years of survey research that the public does not view them as opposite. It sees them as different without being opposed. Second, we have long assumed that ideological identifications are simply summaries of policy preferences, intellectual processes in which people think of themselves as ``conservative,'' for example, because in fact they have a cluster of conservative views. My own work shows that this is dramatically false, that identification is regularly mismatched with preferences and that a large part of the connotation of ideological terms has nothing to do with policy controversy.

Elizabeth's project deals with both of these issues. Her focus is on public images of liberalism without its opposite twin, because their evolutions are not at all parallel. And her schematic view of the development of ideological perceptions does not assume that identifications have any necessary relations to political preferences. Her conception is more akin to modeling the downhill path of a snow ball; it runs an irregular course and picks up debris of all kinds as it rolls on. She intends to focus on that debris, the bits and pieces of images rubbed off from historical events and personal experiences

We started with knowledge that self-identified liberalism in America experienced a nose dive in the late 1960s from which it never recovered. Roughly one fourth of those who claimed the liberal identification in 1965--1966 no longer did so a mere two years later. And that loss was never undone, becoming a fundamental fact of modern American politics. There is nothing remotely of this magnitude in the known history of political behavior. The mystery was why? What shocking event or events could cause tens of millions of people to tear loose from an established self-identification?

I am excited by this dissertation. Elizabeth has divided it into three pieces, more or less analytic chapters. The first, a cross-sectional slice, looks at the meanings Americans attach to liberals and liberalism now. This shows evidence of association with many things, some having little to do with policies. There is (relatively) declining association with the workplace issues of the New Deal (unions, minimum wage, etc.) and increased association with race, protest, and counterculture. Elizabeth's micro model builds on personality theory. She is providing a fresh look at what ``identification'' means. This chapter is completed except for a section based on a survey experiment in the 2012 CCES, for which the data will not become available until after the presidential election. A second chapter, also completed in draft, is a longitudinal account of what caused the increasingly pejorative attitudes and declining liberal identification. It is based on a careful reconstruction of liberal and conservative self-identification going back into the 1930s. It also relies heavily on content analyses building the link between liberalism, race, and crime rooted in the events of the late 1960s. The third chapter, a time series analysis of liberal identification and its correlates, is nearly completed.

Elizabeth was the nominee of the Department of Political Science for a UNC dissertation completion fellowship, which she has won. There are only a handful of such awards, so the achievement shows the high regard in which she---and her dissertation project---are held by department and university.

  
  
Elizabeth the person is a bright mature professional. Her commitment to her work is impressive. She has been a great colleague for me and I can confidently predict that she would become one wherever she goes. In sum I give my strongest possible recommendation to Elizabeth Coggins.

James A. Stimson

I am writing to support Scott Cook's application to attend the 2013 summer methods meeting. Scott is, without a doubt, the best methods student in the PhD program at Pitt. He skills are comparable or superior to the methods students I have worked with at both the University of Illinois and Michigan. I would say he is on a par with Aya Kachi, who is a regular polmeth attendee, (co)winning the best graduate student poster award in 2006 and presenting plenary session papers in both 2008 and 2010.  

Scott's proposal addresses the problem of unobserved unit heterogeneity in rare-event binary time-series cross-section data. His substantive interests lie in the study of conflict, so his thinking on this topic, at least initially, was heavily influenced by the ""Dirty Pool"" symposium published in International Organization in 2001. In this symposium, Beck and Katz write ""Because binary time-series cross-section data in IR frequently contain a lot of units that show no temporal variation on the dependent variable, Green, Kim, and Yoon's proposal to include fixed effects in these analyses is never a good idea"" (p. 490). Within the standard fixed-effects ML framework, these units, ones that do not experience the rare event, contribute no information to the model's parameter estimates. Beck and Katz, along with most applied empirical IR scholars, see this as problematic. Scott is evaluating the relative small sample performance of a penalized maximum likelihood estimator for the fixed-effects logit model, which allows the no-variation units to contribute some information to the model's parameter estimates, against the conditional logit estimator, which does not, as well as against the random-effects estimator, which assumes the unit effects are orthogonal to all of the regressors. His preliminary Monte Carlo results are extremely promising, showing mean squared error gains over both conditional (efficiency gains) and random-effects logit (bias reduction).

To sum, Scott Cook has my highest possible recommendation. If you have any questions or concerns about Scott's application, please do not hesistate to contact me.

I met Alex last year when he enrolled in my Experimental Research class.  At the time, Alex was a SIPA masters student but, after much encouragement from Mike Ting and me, became interested in pursuing a doctorate in political science.  He was a standout in a class of strong students.  Alex has strong technical skills in metrics and computer programming, and he is an unusually gifted writer and presenter.  He is on such a fast track with regard to methods and publication-quality research that I sometimes lose sight of the fact that he is just in his first year of the doctoral program!   To cite but one example of his technical flair and standing in his cohort, other students in the grad program here routinely use him as a tutor.

I realize that superlatives are common in recommendation letters, but Alex deserves them.  The two papers of his that I have read could easily be turned into top-tier journal articles.  He is very strong now, and he will only get better in years to come.  It would be great to get him involved with PolMeth.","Green","Donald","Professor of Political Science","Columbia University","dpg2110@columbia.edu","212-854-0397","received","2547","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-06-12","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

I am writing to recommend Drew Dimmery's poster for inclusion in this summer's meeting.  Drew is a second year PhD student in Politics at New York University.

Drew is working on methods for nonparametric and semi-parametric estimation of causal effects with panel and time series cross section data.  He proposes to present a poster showing results from his investigation of different methods for obtaining and evaluating balance in covariate histories.  The question that Drew is addressing is whether there are efficiency or bias-reduction gains from ""borrowing strength"" across time periods (via smoothing of trajectories) and across cross-sections (via empirical Bayes shrinkage) above and beyond what one could accomplish by balancing on the raw covariate histories.  Drew plans to use these results to inform the development of matching and reweighting methods for panel and time series cross section data.  As yet, such tools remain underdeveloped despite the ubiquity of panel and time series cross section analyses in political science.  

Drew has great potential as an up and coming methodologist.  He possesses a rare combination of high intellectual and technical programming ability. He would benefit tremendously from and contribute significantly to the networking opportunity that the annual meeting provides.

It is a great pleasure to submit for consideration my endorsement of Valeriy Dzutsev, who has applied to attend the PolMeth 30th Summer Meeting in July 2013. Valeriy is an extremely promising PhD student in our department and would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend and develop his methodological capital.

Valeriy is highly motivated to improve his formal and statistical modeling skills and to learn new approaches, including agent-based modeling, spatial statistics, Bayesian approaches and algorithmic methods. He has already taken all four of our in-house methods courses at Arizona State University, covering research design, linear models, generalized linear models, and Bayesian inference, along with a course offered outside the department in complexity, which is part of an impressive university-wide complex adaptive systems initiative. He also attended two multi-day workshops--one on GIS and one on Categorical Data Analysis--of which I am aware. Last summer, he was granted a scholarship to attend a summer methodology course sponsored by SSRC. In short,  he is devouring the methods that we can offer here at ASU, and will likely continue to pursue this interest in his future research. Although we can increasingly offer more courses and training in methodology at ASU, we do not offer advanced training and exposure to many areas of political methodology that will be presented at PolMeth. 

We are trying to train our new graduate students to rapidly develop their methods skills and to write publishable papers. Valeriy is highly motivated to do both. Valeriy is already developing papers that he can submit for peer review at solid quantitative sub-field journals using unique data and advanced methods. Some of these are co-authored with me, and others are not. Two have so far been published, one in \emph{Post-Soviet Affairs}, and one in \emph{Nationalities Papers}. I have seen several drafts of other papers, and I am confident that some of them will be published in top subfield journals in due course. 

Valeriy has an unusual path to becoming a political scientist with a serious interest in methodology. He was born in North Ossetia under a communist dictatorship in the North Caucasus. He experienced first hand and reported on a civil war that destroyed his hometown. As a journalist reporting on sensitive issues amidst an Islamic insurgency and an extremely violent Russian counterinsurgency, he ran into some trouble with the authorities. To keep a long story short, he received political asylum in the US, where he also received a Muskie fellowship for a master's degree from the University of Maryland, and from there he applied to the PhD program in Political Science at ASU. It's an unlikely story from North Ossetia to Arizona, but it's one that has many of the trappings of a happy end. His performance so far leads me to see a lot of promise in him as a political scientist and methodologist.

Thank you for considering his application.

Very best wishes,

Chris was enrolled in my course on social networks three years ago and he has been working closely with Keith Schnakenberg on a project to apply network theory to the evolution of human rights over time in a variety of countries.  Chris will be starting work as an assistant professor at Penn State in the Fall.

Chris is intensely curious about the complex relationships between human rights.  For example, if a government is willing to abridge the right to protest, how does this affect their willingness to torture?  Chris likes to show this nice quote from 30 years ago that says we will never truly understand human rights (and therefore how to protect them) until we take into account how the violation of one right can reinforce and make more likely the violation of other rights.  A human rights regime is a complex set of rules and institutions, a web of arrangements that is hard to understand without considering the big picture.

For decades, the effort to paint this picture has been primarily qualitative, with normative theorists doing the bulk of the work on human rights.  Quantitative scholars have been more reductionist, taking one piece of the puzzle at a time and searching for statistical insight.  Chris’s ambition is to unify both of these approaches by applying quantitative tools to a whole set of rights.  Fortunately, Chris started graduate school at the right time – in the last ten years there has been a revolution in network science and a massive effort to collect information that is just now allowing us to tackle the complex connections between rights for the very first time.  I am very optimistic about this project.  Chris has already discovered that the protection of women’s rights plays a critical role in the web of interactions between rights, and he is currently looking more closely at detailed histories of several countries to add deep insight to the results borne out by the network models.  The goal is to learn which rights are most critical to target for protection, and also to develop an “early warning detection system” that can be used to monitor current practices in countries at risk for human rights failures.

Chris is a deep thinker, and he is extremely interested in all kinds of networks. For his human rights project, he successfully adapted a complex procedure originally applied to product differentiation that was published in Science. This project really showed how strong his computer and analytic skills are.  In particular, I am struck by Chris’s willingness to cross disciplinary boundaries to do his research, reading widely in physics and economics while also deciding to work with a sociologist on his first paper to come from this project.

In sum, Chris Fariss is an ideal person to benefit from and contribute to the PolMeth conference.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions about this fine young man.","Fowler","James","PhD Candidate","UCSD","jhfowler@ucsd.edu","858-534-6807","received","9119","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-03","2013-06-03","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","vegan","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00

Dear Polmeth Conference Selection Committee:

This is a letter of support for Mark Fredrickson. I encourage you to fund Mark's participation at the 2013 Political Methodology Summer Conference.

Mark is turning out to be an excellent young methodologist who articulates and grapples with deep questions about political institutions and behavior.

Mark has improved my own work through his thoughtful and skillful computer programming: he is a co-author now of two packages for the R statistical software system (RItools for randomization inference and optmatch for matching both with Ben Hansen (Dept Statistics, Univ of Michigan) and he wrote an interface to Google Maps to allow survey respondents to draw on those maps (on a Canadian SSHRC funded project with Cara Wong (Dept of Political Science, Univ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Daniel Rubenson (Dept of Politics, Ryerson University)).

He has also shown wide and deeply considered interests in different substantive areas of American and Comparative politics: he is involved in a project on hate crime and political participation, and project on Black elected officials and the dynamics of turnout in the American South, and is now turning his attention to network affects among legislators and issues of representation and local and state government. He has just received his MS in statistics even as he excels in our own political science Ph.D. program. I think there are very few political science Ph.D. students who are equally interested in democratic theory, the nitty-gritty of American politics, and statistical computing.

Since leaving graduate school, I have seen many graduate students in their first few years in the political science Ph.D. programs at the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois because I teach them statistics.  I have also informally advised and read and commented on the papers of a few advanced graduate students at Harvard while I was there as a Robert Wood Johnson Post-doctoral Fellow. Mark is by far more grounded (e.g. he knows \emph{what} interests him and has a good sense for \emph{why} that arises directly out of his experience in political campaigns and his experience as a programmer for campaigns and non-profits) and far more skilled in the fundamentals of math and computation than any other student in my experience at \emph{any} university in my experience (Berkeley, Michigan, Harvard, Illinois). He is also very ambitious and I expect this ambition to be a positive force enabling him to sustain concentrated effort on substantively important topics with lasting impact.

Mark is an excellent bet for someone who will meld high-tech computing with substantively interesting political science and thoughtful statistical work. I have encouraged him to attend the methodology conference. He shows every sign of becoming a methodologist. I strongly recommend that you give him this chance.

Sincerely,

Kristin is an outstanding student and strongly deserving of acceptance and funding if available.  

The poster proposal will focus on the diffusion of legislation across states using a social network analysis framework.  The poster will focus on gun regulation legislation, but the goal is to develop an approach that is appropriate more generally for studying the diffusion of policy innovations.  There is a literature on state policy diffusion that reaches back several decades that has produce some useful and reliable results.  However, that literature has two major limitations in my mind.  The first is that most of the measures of policy adoption and diffusion that are used are very blunt – did a state adopt a policy in a general area or not.  Thus, states that adopt sometimes quite divergent policies in an area get coded as having adopted the same policy due to measurement error.   This also greatly limits the ability of scholars to study how policies are adapted to local contexts.  The second major limitation is methodological – virtually all of this analysis uses some form of event history modeling that assumes conditional independence among the observations (whether observations are single states or pairs of states).  While a necessary assumption in earlier studies, this has never been a plausible assumption.  Network methods are designed explicitly to model processes that rest on a deeper level of interdependency.  In this poster, Kristin (and her co-author, Joshua Jansa) combat both of these problems by using network methods applied to the analysis of the actual text of legislation to capture a more nuanced measure of similarity as well as model the interdependencies among states more completely.  I think this poster has a lot of potential to impact how scholars study diffusion processes more generally.

Let me also say that Kristin is an excellent student.  She earns top grades, is writing an outstanding M.A. thesis (which I chair), and she is currently serving as the TA for my second semester graduate-level statistics course.  She is a leader in the department and an excellent student.  I believe her M.A. has a publishable result.  She and I are also co-authoring another paper, and I think the work in this poster also has great potential.  She is among the strongest students I’ve seen at this stage in her career.  I give her my highest recommendation for acceptance and funding for the conference.","Carsey","Thomas","Distinguished Professor","University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill","carsey@email.unc.edu","919-962-1207","received","5270","Carsey","Thomas","Distinguished Professor","University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill","carsey@email.unc.edu","919-962-1207","approved","1972","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-02","2013-06-03","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","WM","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

Re: Adam Hughes

To the Pol Meth Selection Committee:

	This is a letter in support of Thomas Gray, a second-year PhD student in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia, who is applying to present a paper at the 30th Annual Political Methodology Summer Meetings.  Gray is working with another PhD student (Adam Hughes) on a paper entitled, “Optimizing Samples from Online Labor Markets,” which evaluates Mechanical Turk as an online labor market for political science research.  Gray and Hughes conduct a meta-analysis of published political science and psychology research that uses Mechanical Turk and identify how task availability and reward level shape the demographic characteristics of respondent pools.  They then compare the characteristics of subjects recruited online with a student convenience sample, which allows them to assess the added value of Mechanical Turk for political science researchers. Then, using a series of survey experiments, they develop a set of best practices for researchers who seek to improve the representativeness and recruitment speed of online samples. 
	In short, Gray and Hughes test how to get the best sample for the lowest price on MTurk, i.e., the most bang for the buck.
	I give Gray my highest recommendation.  He has been trained in LimeSurvey and has completed at least 3 large-scale (N=400+) online survey experiments using the same recruitment system he intends to study. He has also been a consistently excellent student in his classes. 
	Please feel free to contact me should you require additional information.

Yours,

with about 70 others.  Andy was in a very small group at the very top.
He's completed every extra credit assignment, and is enthusiastic
about methods in every way.  He's also taking a courses in the
graduate econometrics sequence and in the statistics department.  He's
had extensive experience doing Bayesian econometrics, text analysis,
and other areas.  He's also a terrific teacher.

In the last year, Andy and I have been involved in a series of
collaborative research projects. We have explored a variety of areas
which I think will likely turn out to produce several papers.  The
first will be an application of modern methods of text analysis to
Ancient Greek and Latin, which Andy also happens to know.  The goal is
to use or develop statistical methods that are useful to areas of
political science research focused on idea generation rather than only
empirical confirmation. 

I strongly encourage you to support him.  Please let me know if I can

I write to recommend Chris Hare to be a graduate poster presenter at this year's POLMETH summer meeting. I also hope that you will seriously consider him for graduate student funding.

Chris is without a doubt the most methodologically gifted student that the University of Georgia has seen in years. He has been working very actively with Keith Poole to develop strong programming skills and a very sharp understanding of measurement theory. Keith is chairing Chris's dissertation committee, and only has positive things to say about him. As a member of his dissertation committee myself, I really like the work he is doing to apply scaling techniques such as Optimal Classification to understand how and why public attitudes will align in survey data. In his dissertation, he is even working to expand methods such as Optimal Classification in order to handle ordinal choice data, which is an innovation that I believe will serve as a valuable tool for survey analysts in the future.

Having seen how far along Chris is in some of his dissertation work though seminar papers he has turned in to me, I encouraged him to apply for POLMETH this year because I believe he is ready to present first rate work that can be strengthened by leaders in the subfield. I also want Chris to be an active participant in the 2014 POLMETH meeting here at UGA, and I think he is the student in our program who will get the most out of back-to-back participation in the summer meeting. Having seen how far Chris is in this Optimal Classification project, I can personally guarantee that he will have excellent research ready for the conference.

Also, I hope that you will consider Chris for graduate student funding. I have enough research funds available that I can cover his registration fee if he is not chosen, and Keith Poole also may be able to help him fund this trip. That said, our department has somewhat limited travel funds for faculty, much less graduate students. Hence, offering him graduate student funding would go a long way towards helping a sharp student make it to a conference I believe he should attend.

Thank you for considering Chris's application. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information (monogan@uga.edu).

I enthusiastically recommend my doctoral student Chad Hazlett for the PolMeth meeting. I have know Chad for 4 years since he joined our PhD program and I am very familiar with his work since we are co-authors on several papers and I am his dissertation advisor. 
I don’t like to gush in letters but let me tell you that in my assessment, Chad is flat out the smartest PhD student we currently have at MIT. He will be on the market in the Fall this year so it would be very important for him to attend the meeting and present his work. Chad's dissertation develops machine learning methods and uses them to study the origins and consequences of political violence. More information about his work can be found on his website. He already has one paper that is R&R at PA and his job markets paper is currently under review and I expect it will be published in a top outlet soon. I think he will be a rising star in political methodology in the next few years. 

Please let me know in case you have any questions.

Best,

I have written letters for many Berkeley graduate students to attend PolMeth this year. Higgins is the best, and I have little doubt that he will be among the very best graduate students at the conference from anywhere. Mike is transitioning from Statistics (where he is currently a Ph.D. student) to working working on Political Science problems. Attending PolMeth will be key for his intellectual development and his future career. He is starting a post-doc in the fall working with Kosuke Imai at Princeton and he will be on the market again, so attendance at PolMeth at this career stage would greatly aid him.

Mike is a very well trained statistician with an interest in political science applications. He combines a first-rate math background with deep training in theoretical and applied statistics in the Ph.D. program in Statistics at Berkeley. Needless to say, Mike's statistical training is better than that of any political science graduate at the same stage of development.

What may possibly be surprising is that Mike combines his mathematical sophistication with a keen interest in methodological problems in the social sciences, such as experimental design and ideal point estimation.  He is interested in using his exceptional knowledge of graph theory and other areas of mathematical statistics to create methods of practical importance. There are many problems in causal inference that lend themselves to analysis using graph theory. Indeed, this was Judea Pearl's way into causal inference, from Bayesian networks. Of course, Mike also knows other areas of mathematical statistics well, but his knowledge of graph theory is probably the most unique thing about his technical background.

Mike and I have proposed to present our joint work on blocking in experiments. With experiments, it is often desirable to find more efficient estimators than the simple difference-in-means estimator to measure treatment effects.  Blocking, where experimenters first stratify their units and then randomize treatment within pre-defined blocks, can greatly reduce variance compared to the simple-difference estimator if the strata differ from each other. Mike and I have developed a new method for blocking in randomized experiments that works for an arbitrary number of treatments.  We analyze the following problem: given a threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained in a block, and given a distance measure between any two units in the finite population, block the units so that the maximum distance between any two units within a block is minimized.  This blocking criterion can minimize imbalance in the observed baseline covariates, which is a common goal in experimental design.  Finding an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem.  However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking algorithm for when there are more than two treatment categories.  In the case of just two such categories, our approach is more efficient than existing methods.  We go on to derive the variances of estimators for sample average treatment effects under the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes model for arbitrary blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments. 

Aside from being extremely smart and talented, Mike is collegial, and helps others. I have no doubt that he will make PolMeth better for other students and faculty because he will be energetic and helpful. He has my highest recommendation.","Sekhon","Jasjeet","Professor","UC Berkeley","sekhon@berkeley.edu","510-642-1624","received","2414","Sekhon","Jasjeet","Professor","UC Berkeley","sekhon@berkeley.edu","510-642-1624","approved","4109","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-21","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",5,1,NA,NA

conference.  Kentaro is a Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago
who focuses on the intersection of political methodology, formal
theory and international relations.  Jon Hee Park was his main adviser
at Chicago.  Unfortunately, Jon Hee has left Chicago to go back to
Korea and so Kentaro was left alone without having an adviser who can
mentor his dissertation.  I have decided to take him at Princeton as a
pre-doctoral fellow this past year and will give him another year at
Princeton as a postdoctoral fellow next year.  Kentaro will be going
on the job market this fall.  Although I have known him only for
several months, we have started a joint project which uses cutting
edge Bayesian spatial statistics to predict insurgency behavior in
Afghanistan using public opinion measured through original survey
experiments.  During the fall semester, I had a reading course on
spatial statistics with two other students and Kentaro.  We have read
the papers and books on Markov random fields and spatial point
processes, which are the foundamental tools for modern spatial
statistics.  While I was not certain about Kentaro's training at the
beginning, he was able to perform as well as two top Princeton
methodology students (In Song Kim and Yuki Shiraito).  I am confident
that over the next year and a half we will be able to develop this
project further showing for the first time how public opinon can be
used to predict insurgency violence during civil war.  Kentaro's
dissertation is about military threats and coercive diplomacy.  He
uses both game theory and statistical methods to tackle this
well-studied question.  One intriguing result that emerges from his
work is that the probability of military threat is a quadratic
function of balance in capability between two nations.  This finding
goes against what has been conjectured in the previous literature.
Kentaro has a theory that explains this phenomena and is now gathering
additional evidence to test causal mechanisms.  Given that he is going
on the job market this fall, it is clearly important for him to attend
this conference and I hope the committee will give him such an
opportunity.","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","5400","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","1776","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-05-21","2013-05-21","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

I write to enthusiastically recommend that Adrienne Hosek be invited to present a poster at PolMeth. She is a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley with a focus is on American politics and methodology. Her research examines the relationship between income inequality and voting behavior. In particular, she is interested in how the particular factors generating disparities in the United States change individuals' perceptions of their economic well-being and how these expectations alter the traditional models of income and voting.

At PolMeth, Adrienne has proposed to present work on how to estimate treatment effects in experiments with complex designs. As experiments have become increasingly sophisticated and ambitious in design and scope, methodologists have continued to develop new methods and procedures for handling complex data issues in experiments. For any given problem, there are myriad competing procedures. Choosing the best approach from among all valid approaches requires knowledge of which method works best under which conditions. Lacking this guidance, researchers often end up ignoring the complexities in the data rather than integrating them into a cohesive analysis plan. Adrienne evaluates various approaches, including ANOVA, Bayesian and non-parametric permutation methods, developed to handle problems associated with heterogenous treatment effects, clustering, multiple comparisons, and correlated response variables. The performance of the methods is evaluated through simulation and application to data from real experiments.

Adrienne would be a wonderful addition to the PolMeth poster session. She is also on the market this coming year so her attendance would be especially important for her career.

Re: Adam Hughes

To the Pol Meth Selection Committee:

	This is a letter in support of Adam Hughes, a third-year PhD student in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia, who is applying to present a paper at the 30th Annual Political Methodology Summer Meetings.  Adam is working with another PhD student (Thomas Gray) on a paper entitled, “Optimizing Samples from Online Labor Markets,” which evaluates Mechanical Turk as an online labor market for political science research.  Hughes and Gray conduct a meta-analysis of published political science and psychology research that uses Mechanical Turk and identify how task availability and reward level shape the demographic characteristics of respondent pools.  They then compare the characteristics of subjects recruited online with a student convenience sample, which allows them to assess the added value of Mechanical Turk for political science researchers. Then, using a series of survey experiments, they develop a set of best practices for researchers who seek to improve the representativeness and recruitment speed of online samples. 
	In short, Hughes and gray test how to get the best sample for the lowest price on MTurk, i.e., the most bang for the buck.
	I give Hughes my highest recommendation.  He has been trained in LimeSurvey and has completed at least 3 large-scale (N=400+) online survey experiments using the same recruitment system he intends to study. He has also been a consistently excellent student in his classes. 
	Please feel free to contact me should you require additional information.

Yours,

papers and research employing time series methods and vector autoregression
(VAR) methodologies, mainly as part of NSF sponsored work.  In this
regard, I would rank Mr. Iliev as one of the top 5% of graduate
students I have encountered over 10 years of doctoral instruction at
the University of Texas, Dallas, at the University of North Texas, and
at the Summer Program at ICPSR.

He presented a poster at last year's meeting and received great feedback that helped improve his dissertation project. I also believe that
attending the summer meeting again will greatly benefit his research since
it will allow him to meet and interact with other methodologists who
have similar interests in natural language processing to build
datasets.  HIs current research is well developed and would benefit from the interaction.

Iliyan is very qualified to attend and benefit from the summer
meeting.  First, he has completed his coursework, which included
courses in Bayesian data analysis, time series, and maximum
likelihood.  Second, he is in the late stages of writing his
dissertation.  The feedback he could receive on his work at the
meeting would come at a critical stage in his project.  He will be on the job market in the Fall of 2013.

Iliyan's project, the basis for his poster proposal, studies
endogenous, dynamic, and strategic behavior of members of Congress
and political action committees. His dissertation looks at how campaign
contributions and legislative rhetoric react to each other.
Historically this has been a difficult topic.  This is because
looking at legislation, votes or other legislative outputs as a cause or
consequence of lobbying and campaign contributions presented
measurement and timing problems.  A significant literature on the
rhetorical and financial contributions of lobbies has emerged on one
side of this analysis.  The other side has been much harder: tracing
the effects of contributions on murkier legislative influence and
outputs.

Iliyan's main scientific contribution here is three-fold.  First, he
has identified a granular way to gather changes in legislative
behavior by looking at committee speeches or rhetoric.  These
speeches are coded with a natural language processing algorithm. This gives a
fine-grained way to measure how legislative outputs --- serving as an
indicator ahead of votes or policy outcomes.  Second, he can merge
this with finely-grained, time series, campaign finance data.  Finally, he has begun sophisticated time series analysis that shows that PACs engage in investment and access behavior when making donations to candidates.

Josh is a great student and strongly deserving of acceptance and funding if available.  

The poster proposal will focus on the diffusion of legislation across states using a social network analysis framework.  The poster will focus on gun regulation legislation, but the goal is to develop an approach that is appropriate more generally for studying the diffusion of policy innovations.  There is a literature on state policy diffusion that reaches back several decades that has produce some useful and reliable results.  However, that literature has two major limitations in my mind.  The first is that most of the measures of policy adoption and diffusion that are used are very blunt – did a state adopt a policy in a general area or not.  Thus, states that adopt sometimes quite divergent policies in an area get coded as having adopted the same policy due to measurement error.   This also greatly limits the ability of scholars to study how policies are adapted to local contexts.  The second major limitation is methodological – virtually all of this analysis uses some form of event history modeling that assumes conditional independence among the observations (whether observations are single states or pairs of states).  While a necessary assumption in earlier studies, this has never been a plausible assumption.  Network methods are designed explicitly to model processes that rest on a deeper level of interdependency.  In this poster, Josh (and his co-author, Kristin Garrett) combat both of these problems by using network methods applied to the analysis of the actual text of legislation to capture a more nuanced measure of similarity as well as model the interdependencies among states more completely.  I think this poster has a lot of potential to impact how scholars study diffusion processes more generally.

Let me also say that Josh is a great student.  His classroom performance has been very strong, he is writing an outstanding M.A. thesis (I serve on his committee).  He is a great departmental citizen and a good role model for other students. I believe his M.A. has a publishable result, and I think the work in this poster also has great potential.  As I said, he is a great student overall, and I highly recommend him for acceptance and funding for the conference.","Carsey","Thomas","Distinguished Professor","University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill","carsey@email.unc.edu","919-962-1207","received","6095","Carsey","Thomas","Distinguished Professor","University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill","carsey@email.unc.edu","919-962-1207","approved","2921","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-03","2013-06-03","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

I enthusiastically support Josh Johnson’s application to attend PolMeth this year. Josh is a great methodologist and will be on the job market this fall. As an example of how highly we think of Josh at Stony Brook, during Stanley Feldman’s sabbatical last year we had Josh teach the second year PhD course in MLE. We did have options among the faculty but had such confidence in Josh that it was an easy decision. He did very well teaching the class.

Josh has substantive interests in judicial politics and is doing his dissertation with Jeff Segal. But Josh is also very interested in time series (and many other methods). A paper I now have as an R&R at AJPS sets out the statistical problems encountered when one fails to account for serial correlation in repeated cross-sectional data. I presented it at PolMeth at Princeton, actually, but was most interested in showing the applicability for public opinion data such as using several hundred consecutive CBS/NYT polls. Josh is in the process of demonstrating how the same problems affect judicial data sets where decisions are nested in time. Of course most – if not all – papers in the field gloss over any worries about serial correlation in judicial data. Josh wants to show the applicability of a 2-level MLM to judicial decisions but also wants to extend the model to a third-level, the decisions of individual justices nested in a decision, nested in time. This has great potential and PolMeth is the place to get the right audience prior to submitting the paper to a major journal.

I hope you will have room on your program to include Josh. He is one of two great students we have applying this year and they are both very deserving of a spot.

Re: Elizabeth Kaknes

To the Pol Meth Selection Committee:

	This is a letter in support of Elizabeth Kaknes, a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia, who is applying to present a paper at the 30th Annual Political Methodology Summer Meetings.  Kaknes is working with another PhD student (Heidi Schramm in the Econ Department at UVA) on a paper entitled, “The Political Economy of Health Insurance Provision: Evidence from Mexico,” in which they test the degree to which provision of social insurance increases the propensity to vote for an incumbent political party. To isolate the mechanisms through which provision affects support for incumbents, Kaknes and Schramm estimate the differential effects of social insurance provision by per-capita beneficiaries and baseline political support for incumbents. They use data from the 2005 Mexican Health Care Evaluation, a large-scale randomized field experiment that took place before the national roll-out of the policy. This experimental data offers a unique opportunity to study the political effects of policy through verifiably exogenous variation. They then match the experimental data to two datasets at the locality level: federal and local electoral returns and longitudinal survey data from the Mexico Panel Study. They use electoral returns to determine the locality-level effect of health insurance provision, specifically whether incumbent vote share at both the federal and local levels varies across treatment and control communities.
	I give Kaknes my highest recommendation.  She has been a consistently excellent student in the PhD program, and she is thoughtful, hard-working, and ambitious. 
	Please feel free to contact me should you require additional information.

Yours,

It is great to have a student in the department who wants to bring a rigorous eye to field work, where it is sometimes neglected. 

Hyesung's proposal for the Summer Methods Meeting looks to apply rather cutting edge methods for causal inference with multiple mechanisms to the question of how ethnicity affects the vote. The proposal applies a rather cutting edge methodological technique to an existing theoretical puzzle. Not only does the project involve original data collection, but I believe it could result in a great empirical paper. Furthermore, Hyesung would benefit greatly from any feedback she can get from those methodologists working on causal mechanisms and Polmeth would be a great opportunity to do so.","Blackwell","Matthew","Assistant Professor","University of Rochester","m.blackwell@rochester.edu","714-743-7280","received","3540","KIM","HYE-SUNG","Graduate Student","University of Rochester","hkim82@z.rochester.edu","404-259-9826","approved","8323","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-05-24","2013-05-24","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","WM","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.  In
Song is an IR student who has incredibly high methodological and
formal theory skills.  In fact, his methodological skills are in par
with my former student, Teppei Yamamoto, who is now an assistant
professor at MIT.  In fact, he is a coauthor of the paper I'm
proposing for this conference.  Recently, In Song won the
university-wide honorific fellowship, which is given to approximately
twenty most promising graduate students across ALL departments at
Princeton.  In Song was the only student to receive this award from
our department.  In the past, only two students of mine received this
award and they are Teppei and Dustin Tingley who is now an assistant
professor at Harvard.  In Song will be on the job market this fall and
I expect him to do as well as these former students of mine.

For his dissertaiton project, In Song applies his methodological
skills to substantive problems in international political economy.  It
is a promising project and the NSF panel has recommended to award him
with an NSF dissertation improvement grant.  In Song's dissertation
project is going to change the way in which many political economy
scholars consider the role of politics in trade policy.  To explain
variation in the degree of trade liberalization, the existing work
focuses on import-competing firms who lobby their own government for
protection.  In Song shows that this theoretical framework misses the
second half of the complete picture.  He has developed a novel
theoretical model to show that in order to understand the patterns of
trade barriers researchers must also look at export-competing firms
who lobby foreign governments to open up the market as well as.  His
theory establishes that the degree of product differentiation within
an industry is a simple, and yet powerful predictor of such lobbying
activities by export-competing firms.  Unlike previous theories, In
Song's model can explain variation in trade policy across firms and
products within each industry, going beyond traditional cross-national
and cross-industry comparison.

In Song's empirical analysis is based on an original data collection
of lobbying activities.  In Song used Python scripts to download and
code all lobbying reports that are publicly available under the
Lobbying Disclosure Act.  A number of scholars have used campaign
contributions and yet in order to fully understand political
activities by interest groups one must also analyze lobbying.  In Song
has merged this lobbying data set with various other data bases
including the data about firms, trade bills, federal agencies,
etc. for testing the theories he proposes.  There is little doubt that
once completed In Song's database will also provide a valuable
resource scholars can use to empirically test a wide range of
theoretical predictions in American Politics, International Relations,
and even other disciplines such as Economics.

This letter is unusually long but I hope this conveys why I believe
that he should attend this conference.  He is going to be on the
market this fall as an IR scholar, a methodologist, and a formal
theorist.  It is quite rare to find a graduate student (or anyone!)
who can excel in all three dimensions at the highest level like In
Song does.","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","4389","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","5076","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-16","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

This is an outstanding proposal, and an outstanding student.

Regarding the poster: As Krogslund explains in his statement, fsQCA is receiving growing atten-tion as a presumably more rigorous approach to qualitative methods. Yet there is major concern that advocates of the method have greatly overstated this rigor, and in fact findings generated by fsQCA are highly unstable. His paper elegantly formulates these problems, illustrates them with a close analysis of three important published articles, and proposes a procedure for reporting the robustness of findings from fsQCA. This paper will definitely end up in a journal.

Krogslund’s methods background assures that the paper will meet your high standards. For his BA at Harvard, he took courses up through advanced undergraduate statistics and econometrics, in addition to auditing Gary King's graduate methods course. At LSE, he took a full year of graduate econometrics, game theory, and various substantive courses centered on rational choice modeling. At Berkeley, he has taken both semesters of Jasjeet Sekhon’s causal inference course, as well as one on qualitative methods and one on research design – plus Robert Powell’s seminar on advanced game theory.

From the very beginning, the summer methods meetings have successfully upheld high standards for papers and posters. Krogslund fits squarely in that tradition.

methodology well before he began graduate school.  In fact, I employed
him as an undergraduate and he operated as an advanced graduate
student.

Then, and subsequently as a graduate student, Patrick worked with me
on our Zelig project, coding and developing new models and
deconstructing methods others had created but not really documented in
the statistics literature.

At Harvard, he excelled in my advanced methods class, and has started
on what I think will become several important projects.  Patrick did
so well in this class that I selected him to be my teaching fellow for
the next year. 

Patrick's thesis addresses individual causal effects. One of the most
important advances in the causal inference literature in the last few
decades has been to not make implicit constant treatment effect
assumptions, as in most structural equation modeling.  With new
methods, researchers need not make that assumption, and the resulting
average causal effect estimators then have much better statistical
properties. This direction has improved estimation of aggregate
quantities, but largely ignores the interesting substantive variation
in causal effects within one's data set and across people, regions,
countries, or firms.  By focusing on this variation, rather than
averaging over it, Patrick enables researchers to extract
significantly more substantive information about the subject they are
studying.

Patrick has also been quite entrepreneurial.  For example, he is the
organizer for an informal graduate methods class offered and taken
without credit by many of our students.  They get together and either
teach each other new methods or recruit faculty to teach on specific
topics.  He was an exceptional teaching assistant and remains as a
resource to most of the students around him.

Patrick has my strong recommendation.  I encourage you to support him.

He has a been a student in several of my classes and I am a member of his dissertation committee.  I strongly endorse his application to present a paper at Methods this summer.

In addition to his coursework in political methodology, Paasha has extensive training in Statistics. He has taken 3 years of graduate-level courses in Statistics and Biostatistics here at UCLA, combined with undergraduate work in Econometrics at Columbia. He is on track to earn his M.S. in Statistics at UCLA by the Winter of next year.

His research in longitudinal modeling and advanced Bayesian methods is substantively rooted in the relationships between natural resources and political stability. Paasha's current project on Bayesian survival modeling for regime transitions tests the hypothesized relationship between petroleum wealth and authoritarianism. It fills a gap in scholarly work on the subject by combining cross-national data on oil wealth and democratic transitions with knowledge about the oil industry (via elicited priors). The paper is part of Paasha's dissertation on the political consequences of oil nationalizations.

In short, Paasha is a very strong student who will soon be on the job market.  I very much hope that is afforded the opportunity to present his work at Methods this summer.","Lewis","Jeffrey","Professor","UCLA","jblewis@ucla.edu","310-467-7685","received","3662","","","","","jblewis@ucla.edu","","pending","2179","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-07","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","0","Iranian-American","","","","Complete",2,2,NA,NA

Jeff is excellent at everything he engages in.  Jeff was a Chicago undergraduate.  He was awarded a Sproull fellowship as a graduate student here, providing additional funding beyond the normal stipend.  He has earned A's in all of his technical courses, of which he has taken many in both formal theory and in statistical methods.  He passed our more difficult methods comprehensive exam by defending the paper he is proposing for the summer conference.

That paper, ""A Two-Step Strategic Spatial Logit for Directly Estimating Strategic Interdependence,"" is a really terrific synthesis of the spatial econometrics and statistical games literatures.  As the title implies, Jeff's technique allows one to specify a simultaneous-move game between two actors, with utilities functions of regressors, and then estimate the coefficients on the regressors in the context of a spatial auto-regression model.  The part of this that has really impressed me is that multiple equilibria are not a problem for his technique.  In fact, I should note that Jeff developed a prior -- and in some ways more sophisticated -- method for dealing with multiple equilibria, but then found that a simpler two-step approach worked just as well.  I was initially very skeptical.  I have tried to break his method many times with Monte Carlo analysis, but have been unable to.  When Jeff writes R and Stata packages for this, I suspect it will be widely used, especially since it requires no other data than what we already have (and use) in IR.

Jeff has not TA's or RA'd for me, so I cannot speak to that.  However, he is a very smart guy, who often makes insightful comments at seminar talks.  He is exactly the type of student we need more of at the summer methods meetings.  I would love to see more quantitative scholars like him in IR.","Signorino","Curt","Assoc Prof","Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-273-4760","received","1082","Signorino","Curt","Assoc Prof","Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-273-4760","approved","8125","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-31","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

It is a pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Eleonora Mattiacci since she is one of our best social science methodology students. Eleonora is at the very top in terms of creativity, intelligence and hard work. 

Eleonora entered our program as one of our strongest students and in one of our strongest subfields, International Relations. Eleonora has since then developed considerable expertise in the area of methodology. As a reader of her papers and a member of his dissertation committee, I have been very pleased with Eleonora’s success in our graduate program. She has great potential for making innovative contributions to the International Relations field and bringing methodological innovation to the area. An ability to train top graduate students in both International Relations and methodology is a hallmark of our department. 

We have known and worked closely with Eleonora through her role as a fellow in the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) Program and as a member of her dissertation committee.  Box-Steffensmeier is the director of the PRISM Program, which offers presentations on methods topics, software, and faculty and graduate student methodology consultation. Eleonora excels in these roles. She could expertly explain the simplest technique to a wayward grad student as well as answer some of the faculty’s most complicated questions. It is a demanding role where you need to be very good with many different skills given the diversity of methodological and programming questions you get as a PRISM Fellow. Through such contact, we have discovered that her work is marked by an exceptional combination of virtues, chief among which are exceptional clarity, innovative ideas, and methodological advances. 

Eleonora has identified an important and compelling dissertation project that will be completed this year. We am strongly impressed with her command of the literature and alternative ways of researching and testing her ideas. She examines the importance of volatility in the study of conflict. She uses multiple methods and data with varied, rich contextual information to test alternative theoretical explanations. Her investigation is central to the study of International Relations. She will be leveraging a new data set she has collected to provide unique insight into generalizations that can be made about the volatility of interstate conflict and cooperation. All of this will be a unique contribution to the literature. She has extended existing data sets and assembled and organized some new data in the process of executing her dissertation. This data set sets up a broader, longer term research agenda for Eleonora beyond her dissertation too. In short, she is well positioned to “hit the ground running” upon acceptance of an assistant professor position.  

In the area of methodology, Eleonora has considerable expertise in event history, time series, panel data, multilevel modeling and discrete choice analysis. Her work demonstrates sophisticated methods that are closely linked to the substantive questions that drive her research.  She is extending analytic methods that have not yet received much use in political science, such as Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autoregressive conditional Heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) Models. Her employment of those methods will allow her to take into account not only the mean, but the variance of the time series data. Eleonora also brings breadth as a methodologist due to her use of a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods.  

Eleonora’s graduate work includes several presentations and recognitions. She is an active participant and engaging colleague. She has built a strong reputation for herself by her stellar performance as a discussant. She is thoughtful in her comments and a wonderful contributor to public goods. It is hard to describe in cold prose the sense of excitement and depth of thought that Eleonora brings to her research and teaching. 

In sum, her dissertation is an ambitious project.  Her combination of interests and skills in the areas of International Relations and methodology is unique and valuable.  We have worked together long enough that we have observed that she has the skills, talent, and work ethic that are necessary to plan and execute a successful career. Finally, she will be on the market this fall so the networking opportunities at the conference will be particularly helpful to her.","Box-Steffensmeier","Janet","Professor","Ohio State University","steffensmeier.2@polisci.osu.edu","6149755812","received","3682","Mattiacci","Eleonora","Grad student","The Ohio State University","eleonora.mattiacci@gmail.com","5107175180","approved","2534","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-07","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","1","1","1","","","","","","WM","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

Pete came to our Ph.D. program from Swarthmore College, where he earned a B.A. with Honors.  

	Pete is a genuine—and extremely good—methodologist, who also has genuine—and extremely broad—substantive interests, including political theory, Western Europe (his dissertation concerns Immigration Politics in a (Dis)Integrating Europe), and mass politics generally.  He knows both French and German, on the one hand, and R, STATA, and C++, on the other.  He has taken most of the Government Department’s more advanced statistical offerings and is getting the Masters in Statistics awarded by the University’s Division of Statistics and Scientific Computation (DSSC) alongside his Government Ph.D.  

	In a nutshell, we have no better student (in our department of 100+ doctoral students).  Pete possesses and displays a rare combination of insight, originality, analytical rigor, technical proficiency, and enterprise.  He has been a full-fledged coauthor on our work together—as much a junior colleague as a graduate student.  In a recent invited we both attended at workshop at Stanford, I’d say he was one of the most impressive participants—in a group that included Matthew Gabel of Washington University and Marco Steenbergen (long of UNC, now of University of Zürich), as well as other, less methodologically inclined but widely known and deservedly well regarded participants.  The quality (and quantity) of Pete’s contributions took a back seat to no one’s, and I’d be very surprised if any observer who didn’t know him would have pegged him as anything but an exceptionally sharp Assistant Professor.  

        I have had a good window on Pete’s development, having worked with him on a paper attempting to partition deliberation-induced policy attitude changes (on immigration and climate change in E.U. countries) into portions due to “heterogeneity gain” versus “knowledge gain”); supervised his RA work on another paper comparing deliberations across countries; and observed him at a couple of professional conferences.  On these multiple bases, I am confident that (the health of the market permitting) he will land a very good first job and have a very successful career.  He belongs in a top-twenty department.      

	Pete’s proposal for this conference is for research on “The Multiparty Polarization Distribution,” a careful comparison of the mathematical properties and empirical performance of several alternative measures of party polarization in the context of a multi-party system.  Of course this also requires a careful consideration of the various possible senses of “polarization.”   

   	Pete has quite a number of other manuscripts in the works.  Two have already seen print in refereed journals:  “Thick and Thin Public Sentiments and the Politics of Immigration in Europe” (by Pete alone) in Comparative Sociology, and “Gendered Jobs:  Integrating Immigrants vs. Controlling Immigration in the European Union” (co-authored with Pamela Hughes, Suzanna Crage, and Terri Givens), in Gender & Politics. 

	Let me also note one of his not-yet-submitted solo efforts, unrelated to his dissertation, these other articles, or his current proposal.  Pete has taken a critical look at the prominent but flawed attempts by Charles Ragin to apply fuzzy set theory to political analysis.  Over time, the project has evolved from a “mere” critique of Ragin’s work to a broader and constructive exploration, more firmly grounded in the mathematical literature, of the utility of fuzzy sets.  I think this could in due course be published as either 2-3 articles or a monograph—a prospect that is highly unusual, even among proficient methodology students, all of whom can deploy sophisticated tools but very few of whom are actually doing original methodological work.           

	Pete would both benefit from and, I predict, benefit the conference.  I’ve successfully recommended a fair number of graduate student attendees over the years; Pete is as good and has as much potential as any of them--or any of the other students I have met there.  I strongly urge you to accept and fund him to attend.","Luskin","Robert","Associate Professor","University of Texas at Austin","rcluskin@austin.utexas.edu","+1-650-380-0430","received","8918","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-02","2013-06-02","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","1","1","1","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","153","I would greatly appreciate housing (or funding for it) if possible.

I have known and worked with him since he arrived at Ohio State.  His areas are in Methodology and Comparative Politics.  He has proposed to present solo dissertation work as a poster. He will be on the market this fall.   

	Jason’s dissertation is ambitious.  Importantly, Luke Keele will play a major role in his dissertation, which will be three methodological topics.  One of the essays is on bringing a random effect into an ERGM to address the assumption that the model is correctly and fully specified.  Substantively, he is focusing on the ways in which political networks reflect and shape political and social institutions. He studies Central and Eastern Europe where he investigates how pre-communist political networks, which developed under varied institutional circumstances, persisted through the communist and into the post-communist era. He hypothesizes that these networks play a fundamental role in the process of political party consolidation in post-communist Europe. He is tackling issues of network evolution and heterogeneity in his work. Jason brings breadth as a methodologist to his research due to his use of a variety of quantitative methods, all with a careful eye as to when these techniques are appropriate for the substantive questions that he is examining.  

	Jason was awarded and served as a fellow for the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) at Ohio State.  Through this position, he served as a consultant to faculty and graduate students about methods and statistical software problems. His breadth of methods training and innovative ideas is what set apart his application for the fellowship. He has given PRISM presentations on methods topics and software as part of this position.  They have been very well received by faculty and graduate students in the social sciences.  He is outstanding in this role.  In the area of methodology, Jason has considerable expertise in event history, time series, causal inference, nonparametric methods, and networks. One thing that sets Jason apart is his strong programming skills.

	In sum, Jason is a highly promising and productive researcher at the start of his career.  He has also shown a high level of personal initiative. The elements of Jason’s record provide ample evidence regarding his abilities, drive, and potential to make important scholarly contributions in the future.  When I reflect on the characteristics that have propelled some of our PhDs to be very successful in their academic careers, the common characteristics are ambition, cleverness, and constantly challenging themselves to reach their highest potential. Jason has this rare combination.

	Attending the Political Methodology Conference would be ideal for Jason, particularly at this point in his career. Having feedback on his research from the best political methodology scholars now is ideal timing.","Box-Steffensmeier","Janet","Professor","Ohio State University","steffensmeier.2@polisci.osu.edu","6149755812","received","7033","Box-Steffensmeier","Janet","Professor","Ohio State Univ","steffensmeier.2@polisci.osu.edu","6149755812","approved","5180","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-17","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",5,1,NA,NA

I am the chair of Michael's dissertation committee.

Michael is an outstanding Ph.D. student who has excelled in his substantive and methodological coursework. Michael has worked for me as a research assistant---including coordinating the Judicial Elections Data Initiative---and with me as a collaborator on various research projects.  In that work he has demonstrated the ability to manage large-scale data collection projects (including large teams of research assistants), analyze data using sophisticated methods, and draw reasonable substantive conclusions from the results.  Michael also has a strong record of publication for a fourth-year student.  Michael will be an extremely strong candidate on the political science academic market.

Michael's proposal looks at state courts.  While these courts resolve the overwhelming majority of disputes in the United States, they are wholly understudied empirically.  Moreover, because of our federal system and the unique ways state judges are selected, understanding what is happening in state courts allows us to better understand governance in the United States.  Michael's proposal is solidly grounded in political science and empirical legal studies.  He has taken relevant courses in our law school to understand complicated standing and venue issues, and regularly interacts with my colleagues in the School of Law in addition to political scientists.  

Michael's dissertation project looks at how judicial elections influence the development of law.  He persuasively argues that judges speak to two different audiences when crafting opinions.  First, state judges speak to elite audiences in the state legislature and federal courts through jurisdictional elements of their decisions.  While these courts are the final arbiters of state law, their decisions regarding federal or constitutional issues can be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.  The case of Michigan v. Long requires state supreme courts to explicitly state the grounds for their decision.  These grounds can be manipulated, and state supreme court justices might strategically use the choice of grounds to insulate their opinions from further review.  His analysis allows us to understand how judges can manipulate legal rules to further their legal and policy goals. 

Second, judges also speak to the mass public by manipulating the readability of opinions.  Judges who stand for contestable elections write opinions that are more readable. He uses tools of computational linguists to measure readability, and then models levels of readability with levels of public support for the courts, electoral competition, and judicial institutions.  This analysis will allow us to better understand how elected judges appeal to their ``constituents'' outside of the electoral arena.  Michael's project is part of a growing literature that moves beyond studying case disposition to the actual content of opinions.  His project also looks at the extent to which judges are ``representative'' in their behavior.

In its entirety, the data collection required to execute this project is significant.  But Michael has the time and experience to successfully collect these data.  Moreover, the Center for Empirical Research in the Law has the institutional capacity to support this project.  Michael has significant experience managing large teams of research assistants.  He has led the Judicial Elections Data Initiative team that includes research assistants across the country, and has been the project manager for the Washington University site of the Supreme Court Database project for the last six months.  I am confident that he will manage his research assistants with great aplomb and successfully complete his important data collection project.

In sum, Michael J. Nelson is a gifted student who is working on an outstanding project.  Attending the Summer Methods Meeting would enhance it greatly.

Evaluation For: Mark Nieman
Recommender: Frederick J. Boehmke

Dear Selection Committee Member,

I am pleased to write this letter in support of Mark Nieman’s application for the 2013 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Nieman in three of my methods classes and can say that he is currently one our best graduate students in methods. Nieman is in his fifth year in the program and has taken three courses from me, attended the methods conference last summer, and took Curt Signorino’s EITM-style course at the Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis a couple years ago. He plans to defend his PhD this spring or summer, so would likely no longer be a graduate student by the time the meeting rolls around. 

Last year, Nieman presented a paper that relates to work from his dissertation that develops a censored strategic probit analysis. While conflict data generally differentiate between cases in which revisionists claims are made and acceded to by the target and cases in which no claim is made, such information does not exist for civil wars. This makes it impossible to directly estimate a strategic probit model. Nieman modified the strategic probit model to account for this lack of information in the data and has Monte Carlo evidence and the substantive application. His proposal this year seeks to present an improved version of this new estimator that addresses some biases that emerged in the original version and that provides a new empirical application. This is a very nice paper that develops a new estimator in order to address an interesting substantive question. 

I believe that Nieman would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. He has progressed quite well since attending last year and has incorporated feedback he received into his research, which has led to its improvement, and also plans to defend his dissertation in the near future. He will likely be on the job market this fall, so this would be a particularly fortuitous time for him to attend the meeting. He has also developed into a good methodologist in general and I believe he would be able to contribute to the conversation in general and offer useful comments on others’ work as well.

Please let me know if you any questions.

He has extensive training in statistics and his earning his Masters in Statistics in addition to his PhD in Political Science.  

He is developing a very interesting Bayesian latent class model which he will apply to allocations of federal social welfare spending to municipalities made by presidents in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.  These allocations are left-censored (many municipalities are provided no support) and  right-skewed (a few municipalities receive very large allocations in total and per capita).  There is also considerable stickiness in these allocations over time and probably other source of heterogeneity that must be accounted for as well.  Felipe develops a clever model that links comparative statics derived from a formal model of these allocations to parameters of his Bayesian latent class model.

He is energetic and talented.  His proposed poster presentation is based on at least two years of work on understanding the uses and limitations of cross-national regression in comparative politics. He notes that while scholars running such regressions are increasingly attentive to issues related to causal inference, they almost always fail to address a key confounder for many national level treatment variables: geographical concentration. Because this often leads to actual or near violations of common support conditions, controlling for potential confounders in a parametric regression often fails to hold constant the effect of a posited confounder. In his proposed presentation, he looks at three popular treatment variables in comparative politics: the effects of oil, Western colonial experience, and having a larger percentage of Muslims. He finds that the oil result holds up, notwithstanding the concerns about geographic concentration. However, he finds that after properly accounting for geographical concentration, the strong global sample correlations between each of short Western colonial experience and large Muslim populations with a lack of democracy are spurious.

This work represents careful attention to both the data and the properties of regression estimators (e.g., influence curves and leverage points). It is very interesting work.","Sekhon","Jasjeet","Professor","UC Berkeley","sekhon@berkeley.edu","510-642-1624","received","9900","","","","","jackpaine@berkeley.edu","","pending","2570","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-21","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

To Whom It May Concern::

I am pleased to recommend Srinivas “Chinnu” Parinandi for for the Political Methodology meeting. Chinnu is a terrific student and is off to an excellent start on his dissertation.  I am confident that he would make a strong presentation at the meeting; and know that in turn he will get some extremely helpful feedback on his project.

Chinnu has been a terrific student in our program, earning top grades and even earning a rare “pass with distinction” on his American politics preliminary exam.  More relevant here is that he is now working diligently on his dissertation, in which he takes a new and innovative approach to the study of policy diffusion by distinguishing between imitation and innovation.  A legislature in one state might simply adopt the same exact policy that legislatures in other states have adopted.  That is, it imitates the actions of those earlier states.  Another state legislature, however, might adopt a policy that, although roughly similar to the policy found in other states, also differs in substantial ways. As Chinnu points out, this is not imitation; it’s innovation. And those are two very different things. Yet virtually every scholar of policy diffusion has lumped these two types of processes – imitation and innovation – together, often having a simple dependent variable that is coded as “1” if a state legislature adopts a policy that another state legislature previously adopted, regardless of whether the state adopts the exact same policy found elsewhere (i.e., imitation) or adopts a policy that addresses the same issue but does so in an entirely different way (i.e., innovation).  

In his dissertation, Chinnu sets out to explain why some state legislatures innovate, while others imitate.  This is a surprisingly thorny question, both theoretically and empirically.  Theoretically, you need to be able to explain why states would prefer one approach to the other, or why even a single state might prefer to innovate in some policy areas, or at some times, and to imitate in others. In his theoretical explanation, he identifies the factors that strike me as exactly the right ones to focus on – the greater risk that is inherent in innovating (and which types of state legislators are more willing to take on, or be fearful of, such risk); the pressures created by upcoming elections (and the worries about adopting an innovation that backfires just prior to such elections); the capacity of legislatures in some states to be more certain about the effects of innovative policies; whether control of government is divided or unified (and this whether different branches are likely to be able to agree on significant innovations); and so on.  Much of the research on policy diffusion has been empirical, rather than theoretical.  Thus, Chinnu’s theoretical work promises to make a significant contribution to our understanding of this process.

The empirical aspect is just as important and just as thorny.  Basically, some laws are clear imitations, where a state legislature simply writes down, almost word for word, a law found in another state, and adopts that earlier law.  Other policies are clear innovations – for example, when a state adopts a law that addresses the same policy area as that found in a different state, but the new law differs in significant ways from the earlier law.  Those are the easy cases; the difficulty lies with coding all the laws that lie between those two poles.  Chinnu has worked extremely hard over the past few months to come up with a way of distinguishing imitation from innovation, and has found two creative ways to do it.  First, he focuses on a specific policy area that many state legislatures are addressing – deriving energy from renewable sources – and has developed a way to code each aspect of this policy area (e.g., the mechanism that the state uses for setting and enforcing standards; the rates that each law establishes; and so on).  Based on this approach, he can determine the extent to which a law adopted in one state differs from laws previously adopted in other states.  Second, using computer programs that allow for comparisons of different documents, he can calculate a continuous measure of the difference between a law adopted in one state and a law adopted earlier in another.  Both of these measures, then, allow him to test his theoretical argument and to disentangle imitation and innovation.

For the Methods meeting, Chinnu plans to present a poster of the empirical strategy that he is using in his dissertation.  That is, he’ll present the coding strategy he’s employing, along with details of the computer-based comparison (in which he relies on anti-plagiarism software).  The goal will be to provide an empirical test, using these methods, of the arguments he lays out in his theoretical chapter.  He’ll do an excellent job of this, and as a result, I’m happy to endorse his application for the meeting. 

Sincerely,

This letter is to recommend Ethan Porter be included as part of the annual mtg for Political Methodology.  Ethan is a third year PhD student at the University of Chicago whose primary research focus is in the relationship between an individual's trust in government and his or her understanding of the 'submerged state' (a la Mettler) which he has studied through a series of survey experiments (where he exposes individuals to information about their taxes or government benefits or both and then evaluates the effect of this information on that individual's trust in government).

Ethan has taken most of the quantitative courses at Chicago and continues to work to advance his technical skills.  He started as a political theorist (so is only just now in my Causal Inference course) but he is continuing to try to take advantage of all possible resources to get appropriate quantitative training.  He's very thoughtful and serious and I do think he would benefit from attending this meeting.

Recommendation for Margaret E. Roberts   
   
Quick summary: Molly Roberts is enthusiastic and really smart, and I’d deﬁnitely support her. She came to graduate school well trained in methods and statistics, and political science in general, including an MA from Stanford. She seems to survive on an ever increasing diet of new ideas, new methods, new research, and a whole lot of work. From a class of about 75, I chose her to be one of two teaching fellows for the next year. She was so good at being a teaching fellow that I asked her to do it again and she is doing a terriﬁc job. The students love her.    
  
In addition to an excellent technical background, she has deep substantive interests. These include comparative politics, including banking and development policies in East Asia, international political economy, including the politics of non-tariﬀ trade barriers and WTO dispute resolution, and American politics, such as Congressional determinants of trade policy and globalization attitudes in the mass public.    
  
Molly and I are now working together with another student on a project on Chinese and American public opinion expressed in millions of social media posts. We have a feed of all Chinese and English social media posts, harvested from the web in real time and including many that are subsequently taken down by the Chinese government. We’ve adapted methods of automated text analysis to compare expressed opinion in these two countries. Molly knows Chinese well enough to code text herself and direct a team of Chinese coders, knows enough about the issues and interest of the Chinese government to carefully parse Chinese government statements and to select issue for us to track, and understands the technical background enough to make serious methodological contributions too. This work has also blossomed into a large scale study of censorship in China, including analyses of the text censored social media posts, which we have found a way to obtain before the Chinese government manages to take them down.  
  
Here are two illustrations of how committed Molly is to research. First, when she arrived here, she came by and expressed her interest in working as a research assistant with me. As I always do in cases like these, I sent her back to her classes (funding isn’t an issue for admitted students and the time devoted to classes seems valuable for at least the ﬁrst couple of years). She did as I suggested but then came back a few weeks later, and then again, and again, pushing hard to be involved in research. She just had more bandwidth than others, and we’ve been working closely together ever since. Someone who constantly challenges herself is exactly the right proﬁle for someone who will make it a long way. Second, and just as telling: I had two projects I decided she might like to be involved in and oﬀered her the choice. One was a big, exciting, visible project with big public policy implications and for which there would likely be a lot of media interest. The other involved a highly technical statistical programming project involving aspects of ecological inference. I bet 19 of 20 graduate students would choose the ﬁrst. Molly chose the more diﬃcult path, and we will have our ﬁrst paper on ecological inference together shortly.    
  
We don’t often get students like this, but I wish we did; I strongly encourage you to support her. She deserves it and you’ll be as thrilled as I am to work with her. Please contact me if I can provide more details.    
 
 
Sincerely,

It is my pleasure to submit a letter of recommendation for Steve Rogers to attend the Society for Political Methodology Summer meetings to present a poster.

Among other projects, Steve is working on extending the ""Out of Step"" paper of Brady, Canes-Wrone and Cogan both over time and to additional legislatures (i.e., state legislatures).  To do so, he shows that it is possible to derive a more theoretically appropriate specification for the relationship than the one that is used in the APSR paper.  To better model the notion of ""out-of-step,"" he proposed a specification that models the distance between legislators' ideal point and a projected district ideal point rather than simply assume that all ""extreme"" members are out of step as is done in the original paper.  So doing not only refines the conclusions that we make about the extent of individual level accountability at the national level, but it also provides the ability to compare the amount of accountability across state legislatures.  

A second contribution is to scale the various state legislatures over time and to link them to measures of district preferences to estimate the relationship between these features and electoral returns.

To be clear, while the paper is innovative in terms of arguing for a more theoretically justifiable specification of the estimation equation and while it advances our understanding of the extent to which legislators are held electorally responsible for their individual positions, it is not a novel statistical innovation.  Even so, I hope that you agree that such refinements are an important contribution and worthy of a poster presentation.

Personally, Steve is a very pleasant and sharp individual who would not only benefit greatly from the conference, but who would also make a positive contribution to it.  He is an applied methodologist rather than a ""pure"" methodologist, but I think that he would bring valuable insights to the discussion and conversations.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if there is any more information I can provide and best of luck in your deliberations.

Dear Committee:
I am writing to give my recommendation to Katelyn Sack for an academic position in your department. 
I known Katelyn extremely well. She took the core American political behavior seminar and the
introductory statistical methods course from me; she served as a teaching assistant in my large 
public opinion lecture course; I am on her dissertation committee; and I have worked closely with 
her in the development of her dissertation research. She is among if not the smartest, most 
creative, and most broadly intellectually curious students I have had the pleasure to work with, 
either here or during my three years at Cornell before coming to UVa in 2006. While she struggles 
at times to focus her work and to connect it clearly with the literatures on which she draws, she 
is also one of the most active and productive graduate students I have known.

She took the statistics course early in her career, when she thought she wanted to be a pure 
political theorist. Nevertheless, she engaged fully with the material and mastered the statistical 
content, all the while coming
to office hours to discuss subtle epistemological implications of different approaches to 
quantifying and analyzing political behavior. This broad engagement and curiosity carried over to 
her work in the behavior seminar, and to her ambitious dissertation project. Katelyn continues to 
have an interest in speaking to questions in political theory; she has married this interest with 
an empirical focus on the intersections of political psychology and public administration, and with 
a deep commitment to explicating—and intervening—in democratic practice on the ground.

Katelyn’s dissertation seeks to explore the important political psychological assumptions that lie 
at the heart of theoretical accounts of the rational administrative state: that rational 
procedures, objectively applied, can help align the myriad small decisions made by street level 
bureaucrats with the broad goals and values articulated by the democratic process. In particular, 
she explores the ways that routine, quantified, and technological administrative procedures and 
techniques, though designed to remove bias from the administration of public policy, can ironically 
perpetuate those very biases while obfuscating the operation
of bias under a cloak of technological sophistication. Her dissertation articulates and explores 
empirically a novel model of the political psychological process by which biases affect seemingly 
objective technologies; in addition, she explores empirically the political development of state 
capacity to deploy these technologies, and the effects of that deployment on agency diversity and 
performance.

As this characterization suggests, Katelyn’s interests and ambition are exceedingly broad. I—and 
the rest of her committee—advised her that her proposal contained at least two or three 
dissertations and that she should scale back to focus on just one. While she has narrowed and 
focused her dissertation considerably, she has maintained her commitment to completing a very 
ambitious project that connects with political psychology, political theory, and American political 
development. I was frankly concerned that this would

be undoable; I have been impressed, or even amazed, over the past two years as Katelyn has dived 
into and mastered very diverse literatures (from experimental design, to details of polygraph 
implementation, to the political development of administrative state, and far more); obtained 
funding from a number of sources, including the NSF; conducted many creative and difficult studies; 
and drafted five dissertation chapters.

Katelyn focuses on most directly on the polygraph, arguing convincingly that far from being an 
obscure technology at the edges of criminal justice, the polygraph’s reach is large and increasing, 
especially with the expansion of the national security state in the decade since 9/11. More 
importantly, she argues that the polygraph symbolizes and embodies the ways that more general 
beliefs in rational techniques distort the very ways we understand human behavior. She argues that 
the polygraph—and related technologies of surveillance and forensic inference—have played an 
important role in shaping the national security and surveillance states, beginning in the 
Progressive Era and accelerating substantially post-9/11.

Her political psychological model seeks to explicate the interactions between two kinds of bias: 
that that exists, often implicitly, in the interpreter—the polygraph examiner, the doctor, the 
social service agency employee—and that that exists in the subject—the polygraph examinee, the 
patient, the welfare client. Her argument is that these can and do interact with each other such 
that their combined effect is potentially greater than either along. Thus, she moves beyond the 
relatively uncontroversial claim that street level bureaucrats may have unconscious biases of 
various sorts that shape their interpretations of the data before them. Thus, Katelyn is bringing 
together insights from the social psychological literatures on unconscious bias, on the one hand, 
and stereotype threat, on the other. And on the third hand, she explores not just the impact of 
this interaction at the micro-level moment of a particular interaction, but also at the aggregate 
level, when micro decisions made over time cumulate to shape, for example, the police agencies that 
rely on the polygraph in hiring.

Katelyn has conducted an extremely broad range of studies to explore these questions, including a 
mail survey of licensed polygraph examiners; an analysis of historical/administrative data on the 
adoption of polygraph technology by law enforcement agencies and the downstream effects on 
diversity and on complaints about brutality; several survey experiments, in which subjects 
recruited on the internet (using mTurk) interact with technological decision aids; and finally, a 
study in which she brought people in to the lab to be poygraphed, in order to document differences 
in physiological responses to the polygraph among different racial and attitudinal (authoritarian 
vs. non-authoritarian) groups.

These studies have produced a blizzard of data that Katelyn has made good progress in analyzing and 
writing up. As with any data collection, the results are messier than our carefully-crafted 
theories might lead us to expect. While she is making good progress in her analysis and writing, I 
do not think she has yet developed the crisp theoretical and empirical story that she needs to make 
the project fully satisfying. That said, I am confident that she will be able to do so over the 
coming months.

Let me say a few words about Katelyn as a teacher. While most of us can talk a reasonable game 
about student-centered instruction, I am struck by the degree to which Katelyn actually implements 
it in her teaching. She is creative and dynamic, as her teaching statement and her evaluations 
attest. I have spoken with a number of undergraduate students in my courses about her as a TA. Of 
course they appreciate the creative in-class projects she uses. However, I can honestly say she is 
the only TA about whom 
undergraduates have said that they valued the extra quizzes she gives in section. I take this as a 
testament to her commitment to her students and to her ability to bring them on board a 
collaborative learning endeavor.

In sum, Katelyn is extremely ambitious and has worked hard to keep a very sprawling project 
focused. In the process of helping her develop and focus her dissertation research, I have been 
impressed with her ability to, and insistence on, maintaining fidelity to the political theoretical 
concepts that motivate her work, while cashing out their implication for behavior and for the 
development of the state. Her ability to do this speaks to her intellectual ambition, ability, and 
creativity. (In this regard, I should note that she is also an accomplished artist. Normally this 
would be essentially irrelevant to her prospects as a graduate student in the social sciences, of 
course. But in Katelyn’s case, I have greatly admired the pieces of her art that capture—in a very 
different medium—some of her ideas about the relationship between scientific observation and 
individual cognition. Her ability to translate her ideas from academia to the canvas is
simply an additional application of her ability to translate ideas from political theory to the 
psychological laboratory.)

In short, I think she is extremely promising and urge you to consider her carefully.


Sincerely,
Nicholas Winter

I am pleased to recommend Emily Schilling for the 2013 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. 

Schilling is in her third year in the program and stood out from her first semester in the American politics seminar that I taught, partly because of her strong background in economics and math. That summer I asked her to work with me on a new paper that would use spatial modeling and advanced methods. Since then I have had Schilling in two of my methods classes (one on event history and spatial analysis and another on statistical estimation of formal models) and can say that she has a very bright future in methods. She received an A in both classes and recently passed her qualifying exam in methods, posting the second highest score on the written component that I have seen. Further, her paper for the exam is the first I know of here at Iowa that seeks to develop a new estimator rather than merely providing an in-depth explanation and application of an existing method.

In this paper she develops a method for addressing right censoring in spatial duration models. Hays and Kachi (2007) recently developed a spatial duration estimator but only for a fully observed outcome variable. Right censoring creates big problems for spatial models since the outcome for one observation may depend on the outcome for every other observation. Right censoring makes it impossible for the analyst to capture this dependency. Schilling’s paper adapts the imputation methods of Wei and Tanner (1991) for right censoring in nonspatial duration models to create a routine that imputes the right censored outcomes through rejection sampling and then uses these imputed values for estimation. Her Monte Carlo analysis suggests that this approach works, but also that it may be computationally challenging with even moderate amounts of right censoring. Along with Jude Hays, we have proposed a paper that hopes to address these computational issues. Schilling’s poster proposal for the conference seeks to extend these results to develop a competing risks spatial duration estimator, motivated by a substantive paper that she wrote for one of my methods classes that models interdependence in the timing of Senators’ announcing supporting and opposing positions in the case of the NAFTA vote.

Schilling has been involved in a couple of other research projects with me and has proved to be a quick study in terms of picking up new methods, learning new software, and writing code to get estimates. She is in the process of developing her dissertation prospectus, which will likely involve the application of formal theory and methods to Congressional committees and policymaking. 

I believe that Schilling would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. She is one of our up and coming methods students and is already reaching the point of being more than just a consumer of sophisticated methods. Attending the meeting would be invaluable both to receive feedback on her own work, but also to get exposure to the high quality of research and discussion that occurs at the summer methods meeting.

Please let me know if you any questions.

I have known Keith for the nearly four years I have been at Washington University and during that time he has taken two of my courses, served as my TA for two years and has co-authored a number of projects with me.  I consider Keith to not only be the most impressive graduate student I have known in the ten years that I have been teaching, but also one of my most valuable colleagues at Wash U.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, I think that you should consider his application to the Polmeth conference.  

Keith took his two qualifying exams in formal theory and methods which is unusual in our department.  He has equal strengths as both a formal theorist and methodologist, and in both fields he is top notch.  While Keith's dissertation (which is great, but which I will not discuss here) is primarily game-theoretic, he has a number of projects that are purely methodological in nature.  He has been working with a graduate student named Chris Fariss at UCSD (soon to be starting a tenure-track job at Penn State) on a multi-paper project that develops a new measurement of human rights abuses across time and states.  One paper from this project is under review, the other is forthcoming in the Journal of Conflict Resolution.

For the past year and a half Keith and I have been working on an NIH-sponsored grant at Wash U's medical school with a team of biostatisticians there.  The project is on ``comparative effectiveness research"" (methods of ranking the efficacy of doctors, hospitals and treatments) and it has been particularly exciting for me because the work we have done combines social choice theory, public policy, and statistics.  Keith has been absolutely essential to the success of this project,  both in the theoretical development of our approach and the statistical testing of it using data from the medical school.  Our paper, ``Scoring from Contests,"" currently has a revise and resubmit at Political Analysis.  The paper develops an axiomatically-founded scoring technique to place objects that have never faced direct competition on a common scale. 

Keith is the most self-motivated graduate student I have encountered.  In addition to the projects I mentioned earlier, Keith has also written papers on the federal reserve (the best paper in Gary Miller's graduate class, which will be under review shortly), and on a measurement technique for better understanding the concept of the ``middle class"" (which he is working on with a normative theory student in our department). 

I'll conclude by reiterating that Keith is the most productive and creative graduate student that I have worked with.  He has collaborated with a wide range of his fellow students including  Americanists, comparativists, normative theorists and formal theorists.  He has at least four completed papers that he has written during his three years at Wash U that are currently under review.  Only one of those papers is co-authored with a faculty member.  He is active in the discipline and has been presenting his work at conferences since he was in his first year of graduate school.  I hope that you give his application serious consideration as I could not recommend a student more highly.  Please don't hesitate to contact me with any further questions.

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
While Yuki's dissertation is less developed than some of my other
students, I strongly recommend that he be allowed to present his work
at the poster session.  The reason is that Yuki is one of the very few
""pure"" methodologist students at Princeton.  In my advanced graduate
methodology course, he was the best student by a big margin.  The last
such student was Teppei Yamamoto, who had received junior methods
position offers from several schools and is now an assistant professor
at MIT.  It is still too early for me to tell how successful Yuki will
be, but he has the same level of talent in methodology as Teppei.  In
my opinion, it is very important for students like Yuki to attend the
political methodology summer conference so that they are socialized
with the members of the society.  During the past year, Yuki and I
have worked on the statistical analysis of survey experiments in
Afghanistan and we just submitted our paper for publication in a top
political science journal.  He has also been working with Marc
Ratkovic on a project that deals with the weak instrumental variables
estimation using a machine learning technique.  He has done a great
job as a teaching assitant for my advanced graduate methodology course
in the fall semester and just started to work on a couple of potential
dissertation papers.  In sum, Yuki is one of the very few political
methodology students in the country.  There are many students at
Princeton and elsewhere who can apply advanced methods to substantive
problems but are unable to develop new statistical methods.  Yuki is a
student who will be able to make real methodological contributions to
the field in the near future and it is very important for the society
to give students like Yuki an opportunity to attend the summer
methodology conference.","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","6327","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","3014","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-06-03","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MS","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",4,1,NA,NA

The seminar involves analytic work and hands-on computer programming led by a core group of grad students and faculty. 

Neelan brings a strong math background to his work, which spans formal theory and statistical models.  His current research interests focus on social networks and comparative politics, and he is poised to make an important series of contributions.  His proposal for this conference concerns optimal sampling designs for dense social networks in which spillovers are a real possibility.   His strong technical skills make him a valuable addition to the PolMeth community and to the small but growing number of technically gifted students of comparative politics.","Green","Donald","Professor of Political Science","Columbia University","dpg2110@columbia.edu","212-854-0397","received","8596","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-06-03","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

political methodology in his second semester in graduate school.  The
class had about 80 students from around the university, and he was in
a very small group at the very top of the class.  I chose him to be
one of two teaching fellows for the next year's class.  Almost all of
those who did as well are now prominent faculty at top universities
around the country; I expect he will do as well.

Brandon's paper in my class is very likely to be published in the near
future.  He collected about 90 published articles that use some
measure of ``neighbors'' among countries or states and shows that the
type of arbitrary decision made in each article leads to highly
non-robust results.  He shows how the existing adjacency, interpoint
distance and graph-based approaches offer different theoretical
conceptualizations of neighbors and how almost none of the 90 articles
used more than one specification.  The assignment was to replicate one
article, and he replicated three: all showed the nonrobustness he
hypothesized.  He then went further toward developing a
conceptualization that should enable scholars to make more reliable
progress going forward.

Brandon and I have been working together since he took my class on
some automated visualization techniques for text analysis work.  We
hope to be able to provide some computer-assisted methods for those
who need to read a large volume of text --- everyone from philosophers
to qualitative analysts of archival records to those who conduct
intensive interviews.

Brandon is positioning himself with a unique and highly valuable set
of skills at the intersection of political science, statistics,
automated content analysis, visualization, and computer science.  The
availability of unstructured text is increasing fast: for example,
last year, 10 minutes of worldwide email could fill the entire Library
of Congress, and this year social media updates have surpassed email.
And that of course doesn't count press releases, legislative floor
speeches, and many other official communications by politicians, as
well as many others.  Political scientists are gradually coming to
recognize this mass of information as data; its not in the usual
familiar matrix of numbers, but it as or more informative.  Brandon is
an obvious candidate to help lead this movement.

Brandon is a hard and independent worker.  If you support him, I bet
you'll be proud of the result.  He has my very strong support.  Please
let me know if I can provide any additional information.","King","Gary","Albert J Weatherhead III University Professor","Harvard","king@harvard.edu","6175007570","received","9672","Stewart","Brandon","Graduate Student","Harvard","brandonmstewart@gmail.com","757-636-0956","approved","1334","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-05-22","2013-05-22","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","ML","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

I write to recommend Susanna Supalla for the Political Methodology Summer Conference.  Susanna is a very promising and competent graduate student working on a very interesting dissertation.  Two aspects of her project make it of particular interest to the methods community.  First, money in campaigns flows not only between donors and candidates, but between donors and parties, parties and candidates, and parties and candidates at different levels of government (federal and state).  Some of these connections have been studied individually, but no one has characterized the full system.    Susanna takes on this daunting challenge.  Second, Susanna characterizes the flow of money in campaigns through an innovative use of network analysis.  Where nearly all network analyses in political science are static---they provide nothing more than a snapshot of a system---Susanna describes how money flows between donors, parties, and candidates at the federal and state levels.  Susanna achieved this goal by adapting network tools from outside the discipline, such as those used to analyze internet traffic flows, to political science.

I have known Antonio for over four years. He is an excellent student, the equal of any student currently in our graduate program. 

Antonio's thesis addresses fundamental questions about how form of government affects the most basic welfare of citizens. Put simply, Antonio seeks to identify the causal effect of democracy, military dictatorship, and other forms of government on the duration and quality of people's lives.  This is an exceedingly difficult inferential problem.

In the part of the project that he proposes to present at Methods, he draws on a huge set of DHS surveys from around the world and covering some 30 years of childbirths to move inside national average rates of infant mortality to determine to what degree democratic transitions affect the distribution of health outcomes across individual within a country.  Ask for example, if variation in infant mortality across income, class, or ethnic strata is lessened by democracy.

His work is informed by extensive formal training statistics and biostatistics and Antonio is earning his Masters in Statistics as well as his PhD in Political Science. 

Antonio is an impressive young scholar who will be on the job market next fall.  I very much hope that he is able to demonstrate his considerable talent at Methods this summer.","Lewis","Jeffrey","Professor","UCLA","jblewis@ucla.edu","310-467-7685","received","7614","","","","","","","pending","8653","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2013-05-22","0000-00-00","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MX","","","","","","","","0","","","","","Complete",2,1,NA,NA

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Carlos has completed the four-course quantitative methods sequence at
Princeton and was clearly the best student among about twenty students
of his cohort.  He and I have been working on several projects,
including the project with Gary King which evaluates the electoral
consequences of Seguro Popular, the Mexican universal health insurance
program, using the randomization of program implementation across
villages.  Carlos' primary field is the comparative political economy
and already has two working papers, which I think will be published in
a top journal in the near future.  Over the past two years, he has
presented those two papers and received feedback before submitting
them to journals for publication.  This year, he will be presenting
the early results from his dissertation project, which is about
political dynasties.  As a starter, Carlos has collected biographies
of all politicians for Indian Congress going back to its independence.
This is not a trivial task requiring him to write many sophisticated
Python scripts to organize all text information that is either
available on the website or scanned by hand.  Using this unique data
set, he will analyze the origins and consequences of political
dynasties in a democracy.  Carlos is also planning to gether more data
on political dynasties from other countries.  While this project is
still at an early stage, I am hopeful that he will lean some new
insigts from these data he has collected.  In conclusion, Carlos is a
promising graduate student who I predict will become a cutting-edge
scholar of comparative political economy with an impressive set of
technical expertise in quantitative methods.  I urge the program
committee to give him an opportunity to present his research at the
political methodology conference poster session.","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","9490","Imai","Kosuke","Associate Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","3121","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2013-06-03","2013-06-03","","","","","2013-05-07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","MM","","","","","","","","153","","","403.00","mc_gross = 403.00

I enthusiastically recommend Yamil Velez to present a poster at your 2013 conference. Yamil is an incredibly bright and talented methodologist – probably the very best to come to Stony Brook in my time here. For example, when he was a second-year student we had him TAing our PhD courses in methods and he will soon be in the classroom teaching our MA methods courses. His breadth of knowledge across experimentation, agent-based modeling, time series, MLE, and on and on is amazing. I expect that when he goes on the market in fall 2014 he will compete for the top jobs in the country.  Yamil’s methods interests are varied and he would get a lot out of the conference. But he would also add a lot with a presentation of his agent based model that is a key part of a fascinating dissertation. At the moment we are all fighting to join his committee – me, Stanley Feldman, Jason Barabas, and Oleg Smirnov have won the battle so far but there are others looking to jump on. Yamil is a pleasure to have in graduate school and we want to do all we can to bring him to the attention of the PolMeth community.

As the Director of Graduate Studies and a member of the PolMeth community I only recommend the poster session to a few of our students. For example, last year we did not recommend it to anyone. This year, Yamil is a no-brainer. I know that attendance at the conference is limited but I hope you can find room for Yamil.

I am writing to recommend Melinda White, an applicant to attend POLMETH. Mindy is in her fifth semester of a Ph.D. program in political science as I write. She came highly recommended and has done excellent work. She did her B.A. work at Texas A&M, where she worked closely with Paul Kellstedt. She will finish an M.A. thesis under my direction. She is writing on the use of Markov models and related smoothing techniques for time series produced by automated text analysis systems.

Mindy also served as my research assistant during summer, 2012. Her task was to explore opportunities for computerized content analyses using the PYTHON language as a tool. She made amazing progress, working totally without direction (while I was out of the country). I was very impressed. That work is now being incorporated in a collaborative Midwest paper.

Mindy has completed, with flying colors, the demanding methods sequence here at UNC. She is a natural, the kind of person---not like me---who finds advanced work easy. She is now finishing my time series seminar. She intends to do work in our Statistics Department for an MA in addition to her political science degrees.

In sum, Mindy White is an outstanding prospect for POLMETH and I give her my highest recommendation. She will benefit from the meeting and it will benefit from her attendance.

Sincerely,

I write today in support of Ahra Wu's application to attend the 2013 Annual Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.

Ahra is a co-author on the project that I have proposed to present at this year's POLMETH, ""Assessing and Correcting Publication Bias."" Ahra has been a full participant in all aspects of this project, and I would like her to be there if we get the chance to present our paper at POLMETH (though I will handle the presentation itself). I'd also like to give her the opportunity to consider her own career opportunities in political methodology at the conference.

Ahra is a careful, methodical, and intelligent scholar with a high level of mathematical preparation. In classwork at Rice, she has consistently demonstrated an excellent command over high-level material and an excellent attention to detail. I expect her to make the most of her time at POLMETH, to be a fully engaged member of the audience at relevant panels, and to make new and mutually beneficial connections with other attendees. 

In summary, I give Ahra my full support and strongly urge you to accept her application to attend POLMETH. If you need any additional information about Ahra, please feel free to contact me at 678-383-9629 or justin@justinesarey.com.
