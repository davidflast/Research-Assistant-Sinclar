I doubt you'll want such a long letter, so let me summarize up-front: 1. highest recommendation; 2. extremely broadly and deeply trained in empirical (and formal-theoretical) methods (and in comparative democratic politics & political economy, and in Japanese politics for that matter!)--set curve in my second-semester stats class, e.g.; 3. awesome project--comparative electoral value of the party label, intra-party competition, and effects on policy--done in totally modern & powerfully productive way; 4. Great young man, credit to himself, his advisors, & all w/ which he's associated; so 5. definitely my strongest possible recommendation that he be accepted.]

I write to offer my highest possible recommendation of Kenichi Ariga to attend the 2007 Summer Political Methodology Meeting. I have worked and interacted with Kenichi in many capacities since he arrived here at the University of Michigan‚??Ann Arbor in Fall 2001. I now chair his dissertation committee; he was a student in my graduate courses in statistical methodology and in political economy, in both of which he excelled to say the least, setting the curve in very good cohorts; later, he served as the technical and substantive student assistant for the 2003 EITM summer training program, in which he performed absolutely phenomenally; and he has provided me invaluable research assistance on several other research projects since. In every capacity, I have found his performance exemplary: his diligence, dedication, and industriousness outstanding; his intelligence manifest; his mastery of political methodology, comparative democratic political economy, comparative politics, and Japanese politics all equally evident; and his professionalism impeccable. I have seven graduate students in advanced stages working with me closely at the moment, and I think extremely highly of all of them. In many ways, and especially when it comes to comparative democratic politics and political-economy, Kenichi is my ‚??go-to‚?ù guy among this outstanding crew, in each of whose intellect and professionalism I also have the highest confidence. Indeed, I have had to force myself to refrain from using him lately so he can finish his dissertation. In short, Kenichi has grown into a full and valuable colleague to me, and I am certain that we will find him to be an equally valuable and treasured credit to the Society down the road.
Kenichi is an excellent exemplar of the new breed of scholar in comparative politics and comparative democratic political economy (CPE-democracy), and in Japanese politics and political economy more narrowly, that is advancing those subfields so radically and that, accordingly, is in great demand in many departments these days. Kenichi has completed the full compliment of graduate coursework in economics in addition to that in political science, and will receive a Masters Degree in that field as well as Masters and Ph.D. in political science. In his coursework in political science and economics, Kencihi aggressively pursued empirical and theoretical methodological training, while ‚??Majoring‚?ù simultaneously in methodology and in comparative politics (with a focus on democratic politics and some focus specifically on Japan). Moreover, Kenichi has managed to excel in all of this coursework despite its prodigious depth and breadth and to continue his reading and training in all of these areas on his own also, all while simultaneously handling the familial demands of his young family (wife and children). He‚??s an impressive young man and scholar.
	Kenichi studies comparative-democratic politics and political economy, occasionally with a focus on Japan, as I‚??ve said. His dissertation initiates and grows from his interests in Japanese politics and political economy to study the varying forms and degrees of intra-party competition and their interactions with other features of the electoral and party systems to shape economic policymaking. The dissertation work clearly manifests the beneficent results of all this training, when merged with his equally prodigious curiosity, abilities, and efforts. The comparative democratic political economy literature has only just started marrying our more-thorough, formal understandings of electoral, party, and governmental systems with modern models of the economy and economic policymaking. In these emerging models‚??I have mind work by economists like Persson and Tabellini and Alesina and Drazen on the one hand, and political scientists like Gary Cox, Michael Laver, and Daniel Diermeier working on electoral, party, and governmental systems on the other‚??if we consider parties at all, we consider them to be unitary actors. However, as any student of Japanese politics knows especially well, the degree of intra-party competition can be intense in some systems and, more to the present point, varies across parties and systems. As Kenichi‚??s dissertation (tentatively titled: Intra-Party Politics, Electoral Rules, the Electoral Value of Party Label, and Public Policymaking in Parliamentary Democracies) is arguing, beginning to demonstrate (with formal-theoretical models, I mean), and starting to show empirically, some of those understandings from unified-party models can be radically altered by considering intra-party competition. Kenichi‚??s training, his having taken and excelled in most of our department‚??s methods sequence (empirical and formal-theoretical) and also a full complement of graduate micro- and macro-economics, plus public finance and other germane economics subfields, enables him to bring these strands together to bear greater fruit than heretofore possible. As you can perhaps tell, by the way, I could recommend Kenichi to you on Political Methodology or Comparative Democratic Politics/Political Economy or Japanese Politics/Political Economy bases equally strongly, comfortably, and confidently.

As my comments above will have clarified, I have zero doubt that Kenichi can ably and productively complete the project in this his final year of graduate school. I would add here, also, that the fruit of his project, well-conceived theoretically and carefully and accurately evaluated empirically, will be of tremendous value to the field.
Accordingly, in sum, my sincere and firmly held opinion is that Kenichi and his project are ideal candidates for your consideration. More generally, Kenichi‚??s dissertation work, plus his extensive, productive, and well-designed training in the substantive, theoretical, and empirical material related to his studies, amply establishes his exceptional scholarly promise. Furthermore, as you may already have inferred this from the tone of my letter throughout, I think that you like him on a personal level as well should you have the opportunity to meet him (say, in the course of conference, for example!). He is a very kind, likeable, earnest, soft-spoken young man: respectful and respectable. I‚??m extremely proud to call him a student; I‚??m just as happy to call him a friend.
	I hope you find this letter helpful in deciding to fund Kenichi. If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me by phone (6-1850) or e-mail (franzese@umich.edu).

Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. I have known Delia
since she started in the graduate program at Caltech in 2002.  She has
been my research assistant since 2003 and we have written three papers
together and a software package. Delia is by far one of the best
trained methodologists in political science. Actually she is one of
the very few recent students who's primary interest and training is in
methodology. Delia is also very mature sand I really view her more as
a colleague than a student. In short, I know of no better graduate
student candidate to attend the meeting.

Delia's interest in methodology center on causal inference with
observational data, but also includes work on field experiments and
multilevel modeling. Her more substantive interests are in American
politics, particularly political behavior and representation. 

Delia's training at Caltech is a bit more technical than at most
political science programs. Besides taking two year long sequence in
econometrics, she also took year long sequences in micro-economics and
game theory. In addition, to further her methods training she spent half a
year at Harvard as a research associate at the Institute for
Quantitative Social Science. While at Harvard she took courses in the
statistics department and worked as a research for Gary King. This
included an extensive project coding in R.

Delia has already written five papers while in graduate school, all
using cutting edge statistical methods. For example, her paper on the
impact of voting technologies on residual vote rates --- presented at
last year's Summer Meeting --- used matching and
difference-in-difference estimator to examine the systematic
differences in voting technologies. In a paper with me and Michael
Alvarez on the impact of voter identification requirements on turnout,
we use a multilevel model (also known as random coefficient model) to
determine if voter id laws lower turnout. There are some
methodological issues we are still trying to deal with in this
project, such as how to handle ordinal treatments with sparse data.

In conclusion, Delia is the ideal candidate to attend the summer
meeting given her training and interest. She would benefit enormously
from continued contact with the larger political science methods group
and I am sure she will contribute positively to the meeting. If you
need any more information, please to not hesitate to contact me either
by email, katz@caltech.edu, or by phone, 626-395-4030

Jennifer Barnes recently asked me to write a letter of recommendation in support of her application to attend the 2007 Political Methodology Summer Meeting, and I am very happy to do so.  Jennifer is a rising star in the field of law and courts, and would be an excellent addition to the summer meeting's participants.

Currently, Jennifer is a third-year student in the Political Science Ph.D. program at the University of South Carolina.  I have known Ms. Barnes since coming to USC two years ago; she has been a student in my graduate courses on methodology, my research assistant (and de facto co-PI) on a recently-submitted NSF proposal, and my coauthor on a paper we are currently revising for journal submission.

Substantively, Jennifer's interests are in American politics, specifically in the areas of courts and judicial politics.  Here, she follows in the path of a long line of excellent USC Ph.D.s working in this area, including such notable scholars as Reggie Sheehan (MSU), Stefanie Lindquist (Vanderbilt), and Susan Haire (UGA).  She is currently engaged in a number of different projects, the unifying theme of which is their emphasis on empirically evaluating many of the behavioral assumptions legal scholars make about judges and judging.  For example, a current paper with Don Songer -- which will, if she is accepted, form the basis for her poster -- examines the extent to which judges in the U.S. Courts of Appeals possess the information necessary to act in a sophisticated fashion vis-a-vis other relevant actors in the appeals process (in particular, the U.S. Supreme Court).  Methodologically, the paper seamlessly combines sophisticated quantitative techniques with extensive qualitative data.  In the former case, the paper models Court of Appeals judges' decisions using a random-effects, binary-response model; doing so allows her to control -- in a statistically flexible, substantively-justified way -- for the host of ""case facts"" that typically pollute such analyses, while at the same time getting more precise estimates of her central variables of interest.  This statistical analysis is then supported with qualitative data from dozens of in-depth, in-person interviews with judges on several U.S. Courts of Appeals; Jennifer conducted most of these interviews herself, and their product is a rich, nuanced picture of the extent to which those judges are ""strategic"" (i.e., forward-looking) when making appellate decisions.

Beyond her specific projects, Jennifer is ideally positioned to attend the Summer Meeting.  She finished her comprehensive exams in August of 2006, and expects to be on the academic job market in the fall of 2007; thus, the meeting is optimally timed to contribute to her professional development.  She has a solid set of methodological skills, both quantitative and qualitative, and possesses a high level of professional socialization; for these reasons, she will undoubtedly feel ""right at home"" at the Summer Meeting.  Finally, Jennifer is among the genuinely nicest individuals with whom I have had the pleasure of knowing and working.

In summary, I offer my strongest possible recommendation in support of Jennifer Barnes' attendance at the 2007 Summer Meeting.  If you have any questions, or if there is anything further I can do to assist you, please let me know.

Given my research and teaching interests in methods, I look forward to attending this summer's methods meeting.

I have interests in a wide variety of methodological topics, including multilevel modeling, event history modeling, models for panel and time-series cross-sectional data, Bayesian data analysis, structural equation modeling, and experimental methodology. At Stony Brook, I teach PhD courses in linear regression, multilevel modeling, and event history modeling.

This letter is written in strong support of Bernd Beber‚??s application for the 2007 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.  I have known Bernd for three years at Columbia. Two years ago he took my advanced graduate course on game theory in political science. He excelled in the class, coming out easily in the top position ranking well above his peers.  His formal and quantitative skills have probably made Bernd one of the most sought-after research assistant in the department, with constant competition among faculty to work with him because of his skills in econometrics and GIS. However what is unusual about Bernd is that among that small tier of top methods students he stands out for being deeply substantively engaged with politics and willing and able to do careful field work including work with me in urban slums in Uganda in 2005 and new work in Nigeria last year. The topic he wishes to develop this summer marries these two skills nicely. He proposes to seek for traces of electoral fraud in electoral returns from Nigeria. Because of their general inability to generate random numbers, humans may leave traces whenever they impose their own numbers on returns. To identify when and where fraud takes place Bernd hopes to develop a set of tests to identify sequences of numbers that can be attributed to human manipulation.  The methods he hopes to develop are very interesting from a theoretical perspective and raise real puzzles ‚?? in some instances with small constituencies for example we may expect to observe non-uniform distributions of digits even if there is no manipulation of counts. Another real challenge will be to work out how to estimate, using different types of violations of non-randomness, not just if manipulation occurred in a collection of returns, but which of those returns are most likely to have been manipulated. Developing these methods further could open up rich avenues for exploring manipulation in historical data on election returns. In short I think Bernd has identified a great topic, one that will be useful and challenging. I recommend him for participation in the 2007 Summer Meetings without reservation.

She is a really good comparative politics person who makes excellent use of important methods, and is also well versed in the methodological issues that are relevant in her field. Thus her Qualifying Paper (on which her poster builds) deals with important issues related to the role of leaders (and democracy) in economic development and the critical methodological issue of trying to tease out causality with non-experimental data. Thus she starts with the Jones and Olkin QJE paper on the impact of leaders on growth. They attempted to solve the endogeneity problem by only dealing with leaders who left office due to natural death. As she shows, this leads to an extremely unusual set of data points, and that this has strong consequences for the Jones and Olkin findings. She then does a time-series--cross-section model which attempts to deal with endogenous leader exits by excluding time periods where there was an exit. She has very interesting findings that leaders are much more important in autorcracies than in democracies (where the institutions in democracies give leaders the right incentives, and so the particular leader matters less than in autocracies). She is likely to be a top student of development who uses the appropriate methods and is conversant with relevant state of the art work. Thus she would benefit greatly from coming to the meetings, and I think her poster would be of interest to many people.

I note that an NYU contingent is driving to Penn State, so there are no transportation costs associated with NYU Ph.D. students who attend the meetings.

David has served as a teaching assistant for my graduate methods courses.  He has been my research assistant.  More importantly, he is currently my coauthor on two methods papers.  I am confident that David will continue to make methodological contributions during his academic career.

David and I are currently working on two papers related to binary data.  In the first, we revisit temporal dependence in binary data.  In particular, we examine Beck, Katz, & Tucker's 1998 recommendations for using splines or time dummies as ways of modeling temporal dependence.  We have found that time dummies should almost never be used. Splines are often fine.  However, most researchers simply do not know what to make of them or how to interpret them.  We recommend a much simpler method:  using t, t^2, and t^3.  We demonstrate that this works just as well as splines in practice and is trivial to implement and to interpret. 

Our second project examines methods for dealing with complete or quasi-complete separation in binary data.  Zorn 2005 recently published a very nice paper on separation and proposed a penalized likelihood method for dealing with it.  We are currently examining a somewhat simpler approach, which is to use Bayesian methods for dealing with separation.  Our initial results suggest that the Bayesian methods are (a) trivial to implement and (b) actually less computationally intensive than the penalized likelihood approach.

In all of this, David has been a terrific coauthor.  He has done much of the legwork, programming, analysis, and has contributed new ideas that have led us in different directions than originally envisioned.  David is exactly the type of young scholar we should be admitting to the summer methods program. He would certainly benefit from attending (which he has in the past).  I am confident others would benefit from his attendance as well.

Dear Committee Members:

Dan Corstange is applying to attend this summer‚??s methods meeting and has asked me to write offering my assessment of his work and of this proposal in particular.  Dan was a student in my course in advanced multivariate empirical methods in the Fall, 2002 term.  He earned a grade of A, which was the fourth highest grade in a very good class of students.  We have had continuing and regular discussions about his general research interests and about his dissertation in particular and I am a member of his dissertation committee.  In these capacities I have read the chapter drafts and the methods paper he is submitting with his application. Consequently, I think I have a well informed idea of his capacity for original research, of the originality and importance of his ideas, and of his ability to complete work.  On these bases I strongly recommend him.
  
Dan offers a unique and potentially powerful combination of interests, abilities and background.  He has a very solid background in formal empirical methods, as evidenced by his work in my course and his paper on the list technique first used by Kuklinski.  

He did very well in my quantitative methods class, which covers the theoretical development and application of a broad range of applied statistical methods.   His methods paper proposes and tests a new and very creative way to ask survey respondents questions about sensitive issues.  This paper demonstrates an understanding of formal statistics and statistical methodology and the ability to use those concepts to address real problems.  This is original work, as we did not discuss the list methodology in class.  Dan recognized an important methodological problem related to his substantive work and set out to find a way to improve his ability to gather survey data.  

Dan‚??s proposed work will make an important contribution to the scholarship on ethnicity and on the political economy of development.  The positive role that ethnicity can play in assisting economic development and how that role is mediated by political institutions is very poorly understood, and underexplored.  Yet ethnic divisions are a dominant feature of some of the most vexing regions from the development standpoint.  The proposed research will help fill this gap.  The background work and design of the project are very sound and well considered and I am confident the work will be important and widely cited when it is done.

I think Dan's poster will be an important and interesting contribution to this year's meeting.  I hope he is invited.

San Lorenzo Huipulco, Mexico, D.F., C.P. 14370","+011 52 (55) 5846-7200","+011 52 (55) 5655-1402","dbcrow@mail.utexas.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","	I am writing in enthusiastic support of David Crow's application to attend this summer's Society for Political Methodology summer conference.  I have known David from his first or second year in our doctoral program, when he took the second course in the UT Government Department's graduate statistics sequence from me.  After some interval, he approached me about co-chairing his dissertation committee (along with my colleague Kurt Weyland), which I am delighted to be doing.  

	David is an unusual graduate student, and an extraordinary one.  He completed a B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1989, then waited a decade to begin graduate school at UT.  Much of the intervening period was spent working as a political analyst for Fronteras Comunes, a Mexican NGO in Mexico City, and as the co-editor of its weekly bilingual bulletin.  That's the unusual part.  

	What's extraordinary is David's abilities.  He writes beautifully and argues incisively.  He is mathematically gifted.  I have taught or worked closely with a great many American and foreign graduate students over the years--a comparison set that includes, at UT, Jan Box-Steffensmeier at Ohio State, Han Dorussen at Essex, and Marc Hetherington and Suzanne Globetti at Vanderbilt; at Stanford, Kyu Hahn (in Communication) at UCLA and John Bullock, beginning at Yale next fall; and at Essex and Michigan, Claudine Gay at Harvard, Andrea Campbell and Orit Kedar at MIT, Jake Bowers at Michigan/Illinois, Bruno Cautres at CEVIPOF (Sciences Po), and Montserrat Guillen at the Universitat de Barcelona.  Overall--in talent, training, and ""expected value""--David matches any of them at his stage. 

	Unlike most methodologists, David also happens to be a real and excellent area specialist.  He has lived in Mexico, is married to a Mexican national, speaks the language fluently, and knows the country intimately.  He is also a real and excellent social scientist specializing in mass politics.  His dissertation reflects his interests in political participation and attitudes toward the political system.  

	David's development as a methodologist has been rapid.  He came only recently to the social sciences (from English) and only still more recently to Methodology.  Yet, after whizzing through courses with Mel Hinich, Tse-Min Lin, Dan Powers, and me, he wrote one of the best Methodology prelims I've seen in years.  His aptitude for mathematical and statistical work is truly exceptional, and he has continued to develop this as one of his specialties, attending the SPM summer conference the past two years and the ICPSR Summer program (on a Clifford Clogg Memorial Scholarship) the summer before last.  He has acquired a particular interest in latent class models but has studied a wide range of other models and methods as well.  Some of David's methodological skills can be glimpsed in his working papers, ""(Can't Get No) Satisfaction: An Application of Dynamic Loglinear Models with Latent Variables to Declining Satisfaction with Democracy in Mexico,"" ""Turnout Overreporting in Mexico,"" and ""After the Party‚??s Over: Political Culture in Post-Transition Mexico.""

	Exactly what path David takes from here will doubtless be influenced by the opportunities that present themselves.  In length of exposure and existing investment, he may still be a shade behind some other methodologists in his cohort, especially those who have long been allocating the vast majority of their time to methods.  Yet I am continually surprised to discover yet some other advanced topic he appears effortlessly to have picked up some significant knowledge of.  There is no substitute for talent.  If he winds up devoting the preponderance of his efforts to methods (he may), I should expect him to emerge at the very front of the methodologists in his cohort.  He is someone capable of original methodological work, not just the modal retailing and illustration of methods developed elsewhere. 
 
	David's dissertation concerns popular (dis)satisfaction with democracy.  What do expressions of happiness or unhappiness with the democratic system mean, and what underlies them?  To what extent are they, or are they colored by, evaluations of the economic or other performances of the incumbent government?  What effects do these sentiments have?  To what extent do they affect voting turnout, civic engagement, protest participation, and anti-democratic movements?  These are some of the questions David is examining.  

	The importance of the topic is suggested by Russia's recent tragic slide back toward authoritarianism, made possible, in part, by the fading of the initial Post-Soviet enthusiasm for democracy.  That in turn seems to have resulted in part from a widespread conflating of the government‚??s performance, particularly on economic and security dimensions, with the merits of democracy. 

	David's case is Mexico.  There too there has been a falling off of enthusiasm for democracy from the transiently high levels of 2000, when Mexico graduated from one-party rule.  The questions are why that has happened, what people have in mind when they pronounce themselves dissatisfied with democracy, and what the upshot will be.  David's key hypotheses are that it is those who see democracy as economic well-being and equality, as opposed to those who see it as political rights or as free and fair elections, who are the most dissatisfied with Mexican democracy and that it is also they whose support of democratic ideals rests most on their satisfaction with Mexican democracy as it stands.  This part of the dissertation employs David's own large-n national survey, funded by an NSF Dissertation Improvement grant.  

	One chapter also attempts to locate the Mexican case in the broader cross-national landscape, examining the hypothesis that attitudes toward democracy rest more on evaluations of government performance in newer or poorer democracies, like Mexico's, than in older or richer ones like the U.S.'s.  Here David is also making some use of existing datasets, including the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the World Values Survey, which contain parallel, though off-the-rack data on a good many countries.  

	David is currently working full time at analyzing his data and writing his chapters.  I have just recently read a draft of one of the principal empirical chapters, in which he estimates a hierarchical linear model to show that conceptions of democracy do indeed affect support for it.  Mexicans viewing democracy primarily as a matter of meaningful elections support it more than those viewing it primarily as a matter of political rights, who in turn support it more than those viewing it primarily as a matter of economic well-being and equality.  At his present pace, I expect him to finish this summer and to be a strong candidate on the job market this fall.  

	The dissertation should make a fine book, but then I expect everything David produces to be worth reading.  Take a look, for example, at his ""Crossing Party Lines:  Volatility and Ticket Splitting in Mexico (1994-2000)"" (quite unrelated to his dissertation) in the Bulletin of Latin American Research.  In ways, this is still an ""early work,"" but note the level of argumentation and writing.  This is someone whose work will always be read and cited, because anyone interested in whatever he writes about will enjoy and profit from reading what he has to say.  Very few established political scientists are at the same level in these respects.

	David‚??s poster proposal, titled ""Disillusionment with Democracy and Political Participation in M√©xico:  Models for Binary Panel Data,"" comes out of one of his dissertation chapters.   He uses a three-wave panel study to estimate models explaining voting, other conventional, and ""unconventional"" political participation.  

	Eschewing ""pooled"" logit and probit models on the grounds of their failing to account for unobserved unit heterogeneity, he turns instead to random effects logits, Chamberlain's conditional maximum likelihood estimator (CMLE), correlated random effects logits, and models based on the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).  He estimates models of all these varieties, comparing them both to one another and to the pooled logit model. His results suggest that satisfaction with democracy affects participation even after controlling for the usual swarm of other explanatory variables.  

	David has attended the past two SPM summer conferences.  Some of you reading this letter may already have met him and glimpsed his abilities.  He will contribute to as well as benefit from the proceedings.  If you have met him, it may be unnecessary--but just in case, I urge you in the strongest possible terms to invite him again this year.

I am very happy to recommend Chris Dawes for admission to the 2007 Political Methodology conference.  I first met Chris two years ago when he took my graduate seminar in game theory.  He is by far the best student I have ever taught as a professor at UCSD and UC Davis, or as a graduate student at Harvard.  And no wonder‚??Chris has a master‚??s degree in economics and he passed the graduate level comprehensive exams in both micro and macroeconomics.  This training has been extremely valuable in two ways:  1) it helped him to learn game theory faster than I could teach it, and 2) it helped him understand right away how to do the advanced econometric modeling necessary for working with messy political science data.

A year ago Chris and I began a series of collaborations in which we use data from behavioral economic experiments to reveal subject preferences and then use these preferences to test hypotheses about political attitudes and behavior.  I use the term ‚??collaborations‚?ù loosely‚??I had previously collected the data and I gave it to Chris and said ‚??see what you can find.‚?ù  He soon had very creative ideas for three papers using the data that he fully developed and tested on his own.  It was enormously refreshing to work with him because he seemed to solve his own problems at every step of the way.  And some of these problems were quite technical, relating to very generalized equilibrium conditions for the behavior we would expect to see.  In just a couple of months I came to view Chris more like a peer than a graduate student, and I hope we will continue to collaborate long after he gets his first academic job.

Recently Chris was able to add a very impressive line to his CV.  He is first author on a paper forthcoming at Nature that challenges the experimental literature on public goods games with punishment.  The main argument of this paper is that egalitarian motives‚??rather than motives to enforce social norms‚??may drive behavior in public goods games with punishment.  Chris and his coauthors created an experimental game that isolates egalitarian motives.  The results show that subjects reduce and augment others‚?? incomes, at a personal cost, even when there is no cooperative behavior to be reinforced.  Furthermore, the size and frequency of income alterations are strongly influenced by inequality.  Emotions towards top earners become increasingly negative as inequality increases, and those who express these emotions spend more to reduce above-average earners' incomes and to increase below-average earners' incomes.  The results suggest that egalitarian motives affect income altering behaviors, and may thus be an important factor underlying the evolution of strong reciprocity and, hence, cooperation in humans.  Chris played a pivotal role in the implementation, analysis, and communication of these results.

Admission to Polmeth would be invaluable for Chris‚??s research and continuing growth as a scholar.  He is very interested in combining rigorous formal theoretic work with empirical tests to study a wide range of topics.  In particular, Chris is already exploring ideas for his prospectus and dissertation.  He was recently awarded a grant from Russell Sage to conduct behavioral economics experiments on monozygotic and dizygotic twins.  In this work he hopes to learn whether there is a genetic basis for some of the preferences that are revealed in these experiments.  In my view this is an extraordinarily interesting question and he has exercised great care in designing the research to be sure it addresses potential objections.  If he is right and there is fundamental variance in altruistic and egoistic preferences, it could change the way we think about the monolithic assumptions that are typically made in formal social science models of human behavior.

Chris is a somewhat older student with a few years of work experience, and that is reflected in his maturity and his willingness to take criticism in stride.  He has a great sense of humor and is easy to work with.  He is also very sharp, perceptive, and able to identify the crucial problem with an argument in a flash.

Even though he is technically a first year at UCSD, this is his fourth year of graduate school and he is more than ready to conduct his own work.  I am sure that his poster on the genetic basis of political behavior will be substantively appealing to a wide audience, and the cutting-edge Bayesian methods he employs to deal with the thorny issues of population stratification and linkage disequilibrium will be of particular interest to methodologists.  You will not be disappointed ‚?? Chris is smart, careful, and creative, and he will be a fantastic addition to the conference.

In sum I cannot imagine a graduate student who is better prepared for admission to Polmeth.  His strong background in economics and his mature personality make him an ideal person to benefit from and contribute to this and future conferences.


Sincerely,

Since I am a coauthor, I will not attempt to evaluate the paper that we propose to present!  Instead, I will discuss Justin‚??s work more generally.

I have been at Florida State for sixteen years.  In that time, the Department has turned out a number of very talented scholars; these include Bill Reed (Rice), Quan Li (Penn State), Richard Fording (Kentucky), and Dave Clark (Binghamton).  I expect that a decade from now, Justin‚??s contributions to the discipline will have surpassed those made by these former students; he is the most talented student FSU has produced in my decade and a half in Tallahassee.  Although our doctoral program is built around an extensive methods core that we require of all our students, Justin is the first student at FSU for whom methods will be a major area of research.  

The principal theme inspiring Justin‚??s research is the need for a close linkage between formal theories and the empirical approaches intended to test them.  Although this is not a novel insight, Justin has an impressive array of skills that should permit him to make tangible and significant advances toward achieving this linkage.  He is bright; and very well trained in formal theory, frequentist and Bayesian statistics, econometrics, experimental methods, mathematics and computational methods.  This mix of talents is evidenced in his purely formal paper (with T.K. Ahn), ‚??Evolutionary Stable Signals of Trustworthiness‚?ù (‚??revise and resubmit‚?ù at Journal of Theoretical Politics); his paper (with Bumba Mukherjee and Will Moore, but Justin is lead author) developing a statistical estimator (the ‚??fixed-effects Bayesian quantal response estimator‚?ù), which has a R&R invitation from Political Analysis; and a manuscript (with Tim Salmon and Charles Barrilleaux, but Justin is lead author) that reports results of a laboratory experiment designed to study the effects of ideology and self-interest on individuals‚?? preferences for redistribution.  

Justin Esarey has enormous potential.  I expect him to produce high quality work on important topics, and make a significant mark in the profession.

To Whom It May Concern:

Please accept this letter in support of Jeremiah Garretson‚??s application for inclusion at the 2007 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.  I have known Jeremiah for two and a half years.  He has been my research assistant, a student in my political behavior graduate seminar, and a collaborator on scholarly work.  He is, without doubt, the most promising student in Vanderbilt‚??s political science program and richly deserves this opportunity.  Especially with regard to his methodological potential, I believe that he compares favorably with the very best students at the very best political science departments in the country.  He is special.

The project that Jeremiah has proposed for the Methods meeting is a terrific treatment of the measurement of legislator ideal points.  Using a Bayesian approach, he uncovers recent patterns that are sometimes at odds with Poole and Rosenthal‚??s DW-NOMINATE scores.  His work will, in that regard, no doubt generate considerable interest and has the potential to provide deeper insights on the scholarly debate about polarization.  Jeremiah is well equipped to pursue this project, having distinguished himself as the top student in a very challenging Bayesian statistics course taught at the ICPSR summer program last year.  His performance was sufficiently impressive that his professor there, Jeff Gill, wrote to tell me how well Jeremiah had done.  Indeed Jeff said that Jeremiah knew the material better than his TA did by the end of the session.

That Jeremiah would excel in his high end methods work comes as no surprise even though you might guess that someone with his skill set would be in a department much different from Vanderbilt‚??s.  It turns out that he was a physics major with an intense interest in politics in college.  Given the level of math he was exposed to as an undergraduate, there is very little (if anything) on the political methodology front that intimidates him.  Of course, he doesn‚??t know the solution to every problem.  Rather he isn‚??t afraid to try to figure out the solution to any problem.  I routinely turn to Jeremiah for methods advice simply because he is much smarter than I am.

The research that he has already completed shows great promise.  Indeed, having read and provided feedback on several drafts of his paper on the effect of gay marriage on the 2004 presidential election, I feel very confident that it will land in a top tier journal.  This is cross-sectional work, using existing data sources.  His theory is sound; his methodology is sophisticated and appropriate to the task; and his evidence is compelling.  It is an excellent piece of social science.  It has been a pleasure working with him on projects because I never have to hesitate to ask him to carry about another test or subject the data to more scrutiny.  He is uniquely able to solve complicated problems on his own.

If I can be of any further assistance in helping you assess Jeremiah, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My telephone number is (615)322-6240, and my email address is marc.j.hetherington@vanderbilt.edu.

I am John‚??s dissertation advisor and enthusiastically recommend his inclusion in the 2007 Summer Methods Meetings. 

As with many formal theorists in political science, John has followed an interesting path into the field. I met John while he was a undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University. His interests at the time were concentrated largely in analytic philosophy, and his undergraduate advisor was Cristina Biccheri (now at the University of Pennsylvania). Under Cristina‚??s tutelage,  John had already acquired a high level of training in game theory and decision  theory prior to entering the graduate program in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon. After entering our program, I soon became John‚??s advisor ‚?? both because Professor Biccheri took a position at Penn, and his interests and training so closely fit with my aims and goals with respect to graduate training. I have served as his advisor now for 5 years. 

My experience at Harvard (and my graduate experience at Cal-
tech) lead me to believe strongly that John‚??s intellectual abilities place him well within the top 5% of graduate students in political science. His most prominent strengths are his analytical abilities and his curiosity. John‚??s work on the media is both substantively important and methodologically well-informed. Of course, he is neither a media, nor a policy, ‚??wonk.‚?ù Rather, his training and strengths place him squarely in the mainstream of quantitative research in political economy. Simply put, John is a very capable modeler who is not afraid of encountering empirical applications of his work. 

John's work to date consists of three main projects, all dealing in some respect with the provision and dissemination of  political information. His main second body of work is contained in two chapters of his dissertation. In this work, John considers a formal theory of the market for political news. This work is truly new and potentially quite important. Indeed, I consider it the capstone of the dissertation. 

It is important to note the disparity between 
the amount of rigorous (read: formal and quantitative) work that has been done on the media‚??s role in politics and the amount of attention that is constantly focused on topics such as bias in the provision of news, selection 
of issues for coverage by news outlets, the selective release of information in mass politics (consider the recent book by Fiorina), and the role of the media 
in ‚??agenda setting,‚?ù broadly defined (for example, as the phrase is used by Baumgartner & Jones and others). This disparity can be viewed as either a failure of our discipline ‚?? or as an opportunity.  Precisely because so little modern, theoretically-informed work has been done 
on the media, and the clear and multiple substantive motivations for such work, I strongly believe that both John and his work have the potential to  be very visible and broadly relevant in political science. That said, I feel it  is important to distinguish this work from related theoretical work. In a nut  shell, the main distinction is that it allows for a variety of realistic behavioral 
assumptions. 

While spatial analyses of the media are not entirely new, John has considered the topic thoughtfully and introduced the right ingredients into the mix. Simply put, ‚??classical‚?ù spatial models of the media are either analytically intractable or lead to uninteresting (and empirically unsupported) results such as convergence of all media outlets to the same news offering. John has extended the classical model by recognizing that the consumption of political news is inherently ‚??behavioral:‚?ù social psychologists have documented several key biased in individual decision-making regarding the voluntary consumption of information regarding the unknown. Several of these biases (e.g., confirmation bias, the base-rate fallacy, etc.) are well-known in political science, yet to date relatively few formal models of political behavior have incorporated them. Sam Popkin, Bryan Jones, Phil Tetlock, and others have considered these biases in widely influential works. However, just as with the literature that considers the media‚??s role generally in politics, the derivation of rigorous implications and clearly falsifiable hypotheses from these regularities remains (to put it generously) less than complete. 

The second component of John‚??s dissertation is best-described as ‚??data-leads-to-theory.‚?ù This component began as a simple replication and extension of the much-discussed recent empirical work on media bias by Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo (henceforth G&M). One of  the main findings of G&M is that the vast majority of media outlets are 
estimated to have a liberal bias (estimated in terms of the similarity between the cited sources and the sources cited by Senators of different estimated ideologies). Simply put, John realized that G&M relied upon a single measure 
of Senators‚?? ideologies (namely, ADA scores). Given that the source of these scores is itself politically motivated, John‚??s first thought was to reestimate G&M‚??s model with an analogous set of scores generated by a source with 
the opposite motivations (namely, the ACU). With the blessings and encouragement of the original authors, John replicated their analysis use both the ADA and ACU scores (separately), as well as Keith Poole‚??s 1-dimensional 
‚??common space‚?ù estimates. Interestingly (and reassuringly), the results were substantively the same for all three measures of Senators‚?? ideologies. Even more intriguingly, however, G&M‚??s results are very sensitive to the time 
frames chosen for the different media outlets. Accordingly, John is now exploring ‚?? empirically ‚?? how time affects estimated media bias, in addition to a host of other questions about potential sources of estimated bias, including the provision of the same information by think-tanks to Senators and the media. Asking these questions is leading John to consider (and I believe eventually will lead him to illuminate) the micro-foundations of media bias. 

The details of news generation and provision are not well-understood by political scientists and yet, as John‚??s results already indicates, these micro-foundations potentially play a huge role in determining the ‚??overall slant‚?ù of news coverage and possibly political outcomes as well. 

In addition to being a highly promising scholar, John is well-rounded as an individual (who even interacts well with non-academics!) and fun to be around. He is both generous and realistic with his time and energies. 

Something that I view as a particular strength of John‚??s his openness to discussion and criticism of his own work. Simply put, he is one of the least  defensive (and, relatedly, least arrogant) graduate students that I have ever worked with. He is quite open to ‚?? and, in my mind, appropriately excited about ‚?? the possibility that his approach to a problem may not be the only (or even the best) one. I can not emphasize enough that I have no doubt 
whatsoever that John will ‚??play well‚?ù with others, written broadly. He is genuinely interested in thinking about (but not overthinking) social science problems. He is not dogmatic when it comes to either methodology or philosophical starting points, and he listens to others‚?? opinions clearly and fairly. 

Again, I wholeheartedly endorse John's application and urge you to place him at the top of your list.  He represents a great example of a young scholar whose work is both empirically and theoretically motivated.

applied to attend the summer methodology meetings.  Because their
qualifications are quite similar, I'm writing a joint letter in support
of both their applications.

Hanna is in her 5th year, planning to be on the market in the fall.  She
has served as a TA for the Maximum Likelihood course at the ICPSR Summer
Program for the past two years.  Peter is in his third year, and was a
TA for MLE last summer.  Both will be returning as TAs for the class
this year as well.  I obviously think very well of their methodological
skills.  They have both proven to be excellent TAs, able to explain
likelihood to students, help them with their assignments and solve R
problems.  The students have been quite complimentary of their efforts.
Hanna has also been teaching the department's statistical computing
class, covering R, Stata and LaTeX.

More importantly, Hanna and Peter are moving along well with their own
research, both for dissertations and for conferences.  They are doing a
joint paper for MPSA on public evaluations of foreign policy and support
for the Iraq war.  This involves pooling data from multiple sources,
estimating ""house effects"" among the polling sources, and extracting the
common trend component.  Their work compares a local regression based
approach to the Bayesian approach developed by Simon Jackman and his
collaborators.  They are already well along on being able to estimate
both the local regression and the Bayesian approaches, and developing
the comparison of results.  I understand they plan to extend these
efforts to additional variables for their Summer Meeting poster.  I've
been talking with them frequently about this and have every confidence
they will produce interesting results.

Both students are at a good point to benefit from the Summer Meeting.
Their dissertations are moving along, with Hanna's roughly a year in
advance of Peter's.  With Hanna moving to the job market next year it is
an especially propitious time to attend.  In addition, both have taken
every methods class we offer at Madison, including MLE and Bayes and the
CIC Advanced Methods Program classes we co-teach by interactive video
with Ohio State, Illinois and Minnesota.  In short their training makes

the Summer Methodology Meeting. Melanie is a 3rd year PhD student
at NYU. I serve as her dissertation advisor.  Melanie has taken
our standard econometrics sequence, as well as an econometrics course
with Bill Greene in NYU's business school, and the Bayesian course
with Jeff Gill at ICPSR.

Melanie's paper proposal is what I expect to form the basis of her
dissertation.  She has an interesting model of partisan identification
where she postualtes that the choice is a sequential one: voters first
choose whether or not to adopt any partisanship (as opposed to
the null of being an independent), and then IF the voter chooses
to be a partisan, they choose between the Democratic and Republican
party. The choice of whether or not to be a partisan is based on
whether or not the parties emphasize issues the voter cares about.
And the choice between parties, if it is made, is based on which
party the voter prefers on that issue. This is an interesting
model as it brings up the question of whether or not such a 
model should be estimated simultaneously, and whether or not
is inherently a selection model.

Melanie is exploring several strategies for estimation, and several
strategies for measuring which issues the parties are emphasizing.
She has so far estimated the model with a Heckman type setup.

I think she will have an excellent paper or poster at this summer's
meeting. I urge you to accept her to the meeting.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like additional information.

I am writing on behalf of Ben Goodrich. I've known Ben for about three years now and I know him and his abilities well. Ben is a strong student who is very interested in political methodology. I think his technical skills are definitely better than all but perhaps 10-15 percent of the graduate students who have attended the summer methods meeting the past few years. In short, I definitely think he should be allowed to participate in the meeting. 

Ben has taken an advanced class (Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling) from me and has (and continues to) serve as an RA for me. Ben did well in the class and he has continued to improve his knowledge of Bayesian inference and statistical computing. As an RA for me he has written a reasonable amount of computer code in both R and C++. He has very good skills and will likely attract a lot of attention when he goes on the job market. 

The project that Ben has proposed for the methods meeting combines work on Procrustes transformations as a means to post-process MCMC output from models that are not likelihood identified but for which identified functionals of model parameters exist with work on variable dimension MCMC. I have not seen the finished paper but Ben has informed me of what he is working on and the project seems to have promise. 

In short, Ben is a good student who should certainly attend the methods meeting-- both for his own good and the good of others at the meeting. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide additional information.

I have known Justin Grimmer since he took my class in advanced political methodology.
He did so well, I chose him to be the teaching assistant for the subsequent
year. Those who have been in this position now teach at many top departments
nationwide (Michigan, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Rochester, etc.), and I certainly
expect the same from Justin.
The paper Justin wrote in my class develops a model for compositional data. These
are data that have a set of outcome variables, each with values between zero and
one and which together sum to one, such as votes in multiparty systems or the
proportion of time spent on each of a list of activities. The methods used in these
models typically involve the multivariate logistic distribution to map the data from
the simplex to unbounded space and so a key problem is when some variables have
true zero values. Justin and his coauthor developed a model that enabled these true
zeros as an integral part of the model, which should be very useful even outside the
interesting substantive example he analyzed.
Justin‚??s current project is a Bayesian model for analyzing rolling cross-section data,
which is an increasingly common method of survey analysis in political science.
The model smooths appropriately over time, while still enabling accurate estimation
within each independent survey. The work proposes a solution to the problems posed
by Brady and Johnston in a book on these types of data. I believe the approach
Justin has taken will see widespread use, as it gives answers when other approaches
fail, and its assumptions are more substantively plausible.
Justin has my very strong support. Please let me know if I can provide any additional
information.
Sincerely,
~~

I have known Justin for somewhat more than a year now, as a student in our department, an enthusiastic participant in our campus-wide seminar on statistical issues in network analysis, and more recently as a student I am working with on the year-long ""advanced data analysis"" project which forms part of our Ph.D. degree (along with Prof. S. Fienberg).  This project aims to discover the factors which lead senators to co-sponor one another's bills (an important case o legislative support), and in particular to measure the relative strength of factors highlighted by straightforward considerations of political economy (party, region, measured ideology, etc.), compared to factors rooted in the social network connecting senators and their staffs (reciprocity, transitivity, measures of social closeness).  (He is, if I may put it this way, measuring the relative strengths of the base and the superstructure.)  Analyzing such relational data in a way which is both statistically and substantively valid raises many tricky technical issues, which I believe Justin has pretty much solved, through an ingenious use of latent variables and random effects.  In doing so, he is not just significantly advancing the study of co-sponsorship networks in Congress (as compared to, e.g., the earlier work of Fowler), but actually forging tools broadly applicable to many different sorts of relational data from many different political and social networks.

Normally, our data analysis projects begin with the faculty proposing a topic to the student, suggesting the outlines of methods to be used, etc., in other words supervising the student, more or less as an assistant. Justin, by contrast, basically formulated the problem on his own, working at it until he had something which was both statistically _and_ politically interesting, and then devised a sound and ingenious solution.  The faculty involved, myself included, have been much more mentors to a capable and enthusiastic junior colleague than supervisors.  From my standpoint, it is obvious that Justin is deeply committed to advancing the methods used for the empirical study of politics, and that he will make significant contributions to this area.  Attending this conference and presenting his work will be very helpful to his scientific development, and will go so far as to say that I think it will be valuable to the other attendees as well.

I am writing to offer my very enthusiastic support for Jens Haimueller's application to attend the 2007 Society for Political Methodology Summer Meeting. Jens is currently a second year Ph.D. student in the Government department and I am one of his academic advisors. I have known Jens since he first came to Harvard and joined my course on Program Evaluation Methods. In the following year, Jens served as the excellent teaching assistant for the same course. Moreover, we are working closely on a research project that focuses on synthetic control methods.

Jens is an exceptionally gifted individual, and his performance in graduate school thus far easily puts him into the top 1-5% of all our doctoral students. Despite being in his second year, Jens is already exceptionally well tuned into academic research mode and has an outstanding grasp of the methodological literature in applied statistics and political methodology. He has a demonstrated track record of success in graduate school as evident by the fact that he has already published several quantitative articles in leading political science journals (for example, International Organization) and also written excellent recent working papers on balance tests for matching estimators and a quasi-experimental study of the effect of foreign free media on autocratic regime stability. 

At the conference, Jens intends to present the paper that resulted from our joint work. It focuses on synthetic control methods for comparative case studies. We explain the conditions under which the use of synthetic control regions produces valid inference. Quite remarkably, the identification conditions are much more general than those of the usual linear panel data (diff-in-diffs) model. In particular, we show that the identification conditions behind the synthetic control method can accommodate multiple unobserved common factors (with factor loadings that vary across regions). This is, in my opinion, a quite general identification scheme. 

We also explain why the standard errors usually employed in comparative case studies measure only uncertainty about aggregate data and thus fail to account for the more fundamental uncertainty about the quality of the control group to approximate the counterfactual of interest. We propose a permutation-like method to produce valid inference and demonstrate the use of the method in two empirical applications (one using U.S. states as the unit of observation and the other using country level data). 

Throughout this research project, Jens has demonstrated exceptional creativity and commitment to research. He has made important contributions to the theoretical aspects of the paper, contributed the idea and data for both empirical applications, and conducted most of the data analysis. He was also instrumental in the development of the companion software. 

There is no doubt in my mind that in a few years Jens will be regarded as one of the most recognizable leaders in analytical methods for Political Science research. He has the potential and the drive to be a star. Presenting this work at the Summer Meeting would give him a unique opportunity to show his recent work to the political methodology audience and gather valuable feedback to improve it. I support his application enthusiastically and without reservations.

Dear Sir/Madam:

It is my great pleasure to write this letter in support of Tobias Hofmann and his application to the 24th annual Society for Political Methodology Summer Conference at Pennsylvania State University. Tobias and I have been colleagues since September 2006 here at Princeton University, where I am currently on leave from my position as Assistant Professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland. We are among the group of Fellows in residence at the Center for Globalization and Governance this academic year. The Center comprises an active intellectual community within the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and I have had many occasions to interact and participate with Tobias at seminars, conferences, and other less formal gatherings. Tobias has been an excellent colleague. Intellectually, he is very engaging and enthusiastic, and, given the interdisciplinary nature of his work, he has effortlessly integrated into the larger Princeton community of political scientists and economists and the North American academic community at large.

In learning about Tobias‚?? ongoing research, I have been strongly impressed by three particular projects that I believe have the potential to yield significant contributions in the field. 

First, Tobias‚?? collaborative work with Lena M. Schaffer from the ETH Zurich on civil peace and conflict, on which he has proposed a poster presentation at the Society for Political Methodology Summer Conference, is not only substantively compelling but also brings greater methodological innovation to the existing literature. Employing a two-stage selection duration model, Tobias and Ms. Schaffer look at the length of post-conflict peace, controlling for the non-random selection of civil wars and the bias it can induce. The application of the latest developments in political methodology to an important political science question that has so far been overlooked in the literature makes the proposed poster particularly appropriate for the Summer Meeting.

Among his other ongoing work, Tobias‚?? doctoral research on regional integration agreements (RIAs) presents an innovative way of thinking about state-led international governance in the globalization era. As a project that focuses on theoretical modeling and quantitative empirical testing, it investigates the lessons that may be derived from the European Union (EU) for other RIAs among advanced industrial economies, as well as for developing countries. In doing so, the project subjects existing models to greater theoretical and empirical scrutiny and, as a consequence, fosters the elaboration of models that identify what elements of RIAs may be most applicable and feasible outside Europe. The project will contribute significantly to the ongoing debate about globalization, governance, and development. 

Finally, Tobias‚?? papers on non-compliance with EU law present as well a novel approach to identifying the determinants of compliance, but from the perspective of failures rather than successes of supranational law. It is theoretically compelling in that insights into compliance may well come from understanding causes of non-compliance. Empirically, the analyses in the papers also utilize a unique dataset on infringements of EU law, and continued development and use of the dataset are likely to yield several more publications on (non-)compliance. The set of papers reflects as well a broader interest in the effectiveness of international institutions, a topic on which Tobias is co-organizing a conference with Helen Milner and Bumba Mukherjee for this spring here at Princeton University. 

Tobias‚?? background includes both substantial training and extensive teaching experience in the areas of international political economy, European integration, and formal and especially quantitative methods, which will enable him to benefit greatly from participation in the 2007 Summer Meeting. I have the highest confidence that Tobias would contribute productively and intellectually to this year‚??s methods conference, much as he has done so here at Princeton in workshops, seminars, and colloquia. 

Again, I am delighted to support Tobias Hofmann and his application to the Society for Political Methodology Summer Conference. He is a thoroughly impressive, personable, and valued colleague, and I have appreciated both his impeccable sense of logic and his equally excellent humor, whether around the seminar table or the lunch table. I look forward with great optimism and confidence to his advancement as a scholar and urge you to give his application the most favorable consideration.


Sincerely,
Soo Yeon Kim

Here‚??s my prediction: Dan Hopkins will be recognized as a leader in the Ô¨Åeld in a few years. He‚??s got all the attributes of someone in this category. He is remarkably insightful, works all the time, is highly productive, is mostly interested in substance but on the cutting edge methodologically, and also happens to be a world class teacher. 
I have known Dan Hopkins since he was a Ô¨Årst year graduate student in my class, then as my research assistant, my teaching fellow, and now as a collaborator and independent scholar. 
Dan is a student of state and local politics. He came to us after a very successful undergraduate experience, during which he wrote a senior thesis on the Spanish Civil War. He has also had considerable practical experience directly observing politics and politicians both in New York City, and on Capital Hill. Although his pre-graduate academic work was mostly historical, he turned to improving his methodological skill set in graduate school by signing up for a diÔ¨?cult series of mathematics and statistics courses and did very well. As a second year graduate student, Dan was already coauthoring scholarly papers with faculty, including with Beth Simmons on a paper that has now appeared in the APSR. 
Dan and I have two projects underway. One is an experimental study of improve¬¨ments in the anchoring vignettes approach to reducing diÔ¨?erential item functioning problems in survey research (the problem that occurs when diÔ¨?erent people interpret the same questions in diÔ¨?erent ways). We have also just Ô¨Ånished a paper on a new method of extracting information from text automatically. This enabled us to ex¬¨tract political information from the millions of Americans who express their political opinions in blogs on the web. We have devised a way to download all English lan¬¨guage blog posts every day, and to summarize quantitatively the opinions expressed in these blogs about each of the contenders for the 2008 presidential nominations. 
Dan‚??s thesis is on the eÔ¨?ect of the ethnic diversity of local communities and its eÔ¨?ect on investments in public infrastructure. Previous research studied the time period 
following the 1960s when ‚??diversity‚?ù meant that a town had African Americans. And black-white politics was a cleavage issue in national politics, clearly dividing the two parties. As a result, and as the literature has shown, higher levels of di¬¨versity were associated with reductions in public infrastructure by American local governments. Today, diversity is increasing dramatically, but due primarily to immi¬¨gration. A larger fraction of Americans are now immigrants than at any time since not long after the beginning of the last century, and the fraction keeps growing. The direct implication of this is the prediction of a steady destruction of American local government and its investments in community and public infrastructure: the pre¬¨diction is that the commons will witness bigger and more sustained tragedies than ever before. 
Dan shows that this implication, and this general view of American politics, is wrong. What is required for diversity or anything else to cause a reduction in public investment, according to Dan, is for it to coincide with party cleavages in national politics. So ‚??diversity‚?ù in post-1960s American coincided with the split between the national parties, but each national party is split from within on issues of immigration. As such, there are a number of localities that make an issue of immigration, but the overall eÔ¨?ects in infrastructure are very small or nonexistent. We witness dramatic eÔ¨?ects in local politics when it engages issues in resonance with the more dominant national politics. This explains what happened in the 60s and what is happening today. Dan has collected what is probably the largest set of data to study these issues than has ever been constructed, and I expect the Ô¨Ånal result of this project to be a major book or series of articles that changes the way we think of these issues. 
Dan has also written interesting papers on the exogenous eÔ¨?ects of Hurricane Kat¬¨rina on communities. To do this, Dan took quick advantage of a valuable research situation and gathered a great deal of data and applied some sophisticated method¬¨ological techniques to extract useful information. 
I mentioned that Dan is a superb teacher. Dan had 25 students in the section of my methods class he taught and received an average rating of 4.92 out of 5. This is an extraordinary performance, and indeed every student but one gave him a perfect score. He received nearly comparable scores teaching a public opinion class. Dan has also served as a residential and academic advisor to hundreds of undergraduates over the past four years, and his advisees have almost all given him perfect scores. 
Dan is someone students, faculty, and others want to have around. I think you probably will too and encourage you to take a look.

Box 4925, Berkeley, CA 94704","5105171748","","iris_hui@berkeley.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","I am writing to unreservedly support Iris Hui's application to the 
2007 Summer Methods Meeting. In my course and through her own diverse 
research, Iris has shown excellent promise as a quantitative 
researcher. Attending the Summer Methods Meeting would be an excellent 
opportunity for her to receive feedback on her research, as well as 
get exposure to a likeminded community of scholars. 
 
Six Berkeley students are applying this year to attend the methods 
meeting, and Iris is one of the two best.  Three of the six are 
excellent (Rocio Titiunik &gt; Danny Hidalgo &gt; Iris Hui): in the top 10% 
of students who have attended the methods meeting over the past 10 
years I've gone. And three others are good (Amy Lerman, Andrew Kelly, 
Alex Theodoridis): in the top quarter of graduate students who 
have attended over the past decade.  I should also note, given that 
some people seem to be interested in such things, that Iris Hui is a 
women. 
 
Iris will know more about spatial statistics than anyone else in the 
room at PolMeth (with the possible exception of Wendy Tam Cho).  Iris 
is interested in GIS and spatial statistics. Space, unfortunately, is 
often left out in many important political science questions. As a 
result, we often get unreliable results that sometimes contradict our 
common sense.  She wants to develop alternative research designs that 
go beyond the linear model by incorporating spatial and temporal 
dimensions.  She is well trained in GIS and spatial statistics. Iris 
runs a seminar (SSIP) at Berkeley in this area, and is a recipient of 
the SPACE award given by the Center for Spatially Integrated Social 
Science (CSISS) which acknowledged her effort in introducing spatial 
thinking in social science.

LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FOR GYUNG-HO JEONG:


I have known Gyung-Ho since he arrived at Washington University as a first year student.   He took my introduction to mathematical modeling in political science, where he did an outstanding job.   

Since then, Gyung-Ho has taken my  course in comparative bureaucracy, and mastered separation-of-powers models, principal-agency theory, and game theory.   He has also taken all the methods courses he could get.  

A year ago, on his own initiative, Gyung-Ho figured out a way to use clues from the agenda process to locate the ideal points of legislators on a single bill, and then locate the alternative forms of the bill itself in the same space.  The ideal points allowed him to calculate the uncovered set, and then test whether the final outcome was in fact contained in the uncovered set.   He demonstrated the technique on the votes on the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, where the issues involved were centralization and degree of presidential control.   His analysis shows the Democrats in a cluster preferring decentralized regional banks and more presidential control, most Republicans preferring a centralized national bank and less control by the president, and a few Republicans preferring less presidential control and more decentralization.  The uncovered space was calculated to occupy the (mostly empty) center.  The final outcome and most of the amendments voted on were in this compromise zone, indicating that neither party got its first choice.   This paper is highly original, and is being considered at Policy Analysis after a very constructive R&R.  

Gyung-Ho could go on the market either in international political economy or in bureaucracy.   If he takes a job in bureaucracy, he will attain a level of proficiency in methods that only a few other bureaucracy scholars, such as Andy Whitford, have attained.    

I am happy to recommend him for the summer program in methods.

I have worked with and come to know Kyle Joyce very well in the last three years. I have both taught him advanced methods courses and also co-taught them with him. I have coauthored with him. I have supervised him in his capacity as graduate fellow for Penn State‚??s social science methods program (now called QuaSSI‚??the Quantitative Social Science Initiative). And he and I have talked at length‚??often over a beer writing on napkins‚??about methods problems that remain to be solved in a variety of venues of interest to us both.  Jan Box-Steffensmeier and I have been so pleased with Kyle‚??s contribution to our forthcoming Political Analysis article on repeated events duration models that we have asked him to work with us on our NSF funded (Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics) project extending this work. I can say unequivocally that Kyle belongs at the methods meetings.  Kyle possesses an impressive and broad background in quantitative methods. Further, his research agenda ensures that he will make original contributions to the methods literature.  I expand on this below.

My most relevant interactions with Kyle have come from co-teaching an advanced graduate course on Monte Carlo experiments and from coauthoring with him.  The co-teaching experience was a delight. The course was completely a joint effort. It was conceived as part of Kyle‚??s work as graduate fellow for Quantitative Social Science Initiative (QuaSSI) at Penn State.  We spent a semester working through problems with competing risk duration models in a particular application and decided that in order to answer the question at hand we needed to simulate data generating processes with the characteristics we hypothesized to be driving the results.  Kyle read a wide array of material on Monte Carlo analysis and after doing this reading, I invited Kyle to teach a course on Monte Carlo experiments with me. We shared in everything from defining the content, presenting the material, designing the homework, meeting with students, and grading.  Kyle composed and delivered lectures on the underlying probability theory and on writing simulations, to name a couple.  He was responsible for teaching the students all the programming (in R) as well.  The students had high praise for Kyle and I found him to be clear, accurate, precise, and intuitive in his presentations. He was an invaluable asset in the classroom.

In part because of the exceptional experience working with Kyle in this capacity, Jan Box-Steffensmeier and I asked Kyle to be a coathur on our ongoing work on models for repeated events duration models. Kyle has proven an invaluable contributor on our first paper, soon to be published in Political Analysis.  He drafted much of the paper, identified the applications and estimated the applied models, and derived confidence intervals for the variance of the random effect, a problem not solved previously in the literature.  Drawing on Therneau‚??s incomplete work, Kyle figured out how to compute confidence intervals from the profile likelihood in our conditional frailty model.  He‚??s currently tackling the standard errors on the estimated frailties for each unit, another problem that Therneau‚??the leading biostatistician on these models‚??pronounces difficult and as yet unanswered in the literature.   Both of these problems push the limits of commonly applied random effects models.  His work on these problems has led Jan and me to ask Kyle to work with us on additional papers as part of our NSF grant extending methods for repeated events duration models.  We hope that he becomes a regular collaborator.  In addition to working with us on this project, I expect Kyle to pursue offshoots of this project on his own, particular as they relate to competing risks, an area that Jan and I have left (for much later, perhaps).

Kyle has attended both the Santa Fe Institute and EITM and is putting the knowledge he gained in each venue to work in his dissertation. Kyle has developed a theoretical model designed to address the question: When do states choose to join wars?  Formal models alone are inadequate to answer this question given the large number of players; formal solutions are impossible to derive when the number of potential joiners is as large as it is in practice. He has written a computational model to test the theoretical model and has collected data to test the predictions of the model in a dynamic setting.  His dissertation is quite ambitious and proceeding well.   It has been supported by a dissertation fellowship from the Methodology, Measurement and Statistics section of the National Science Foundation.  This project is the basis for his poster proposal. With the original data now collected, the poster promises to be substantively and methodologically innovative.

Aya comes to Illinois‚??s Ph.D program from Duke University where she obtained her M.A. in Economics.  There, she completed some Ph.D coursework in Economics as well as five Ph.D courses in Political Science.  Hence, although she is just in her second year with our program, she is quite advanced in her coursework already.  Her interests, even while at Duke, have been more consistent with Political Science, so moving to Political Science was a natural fit.  Her Master‚??s project analyzed the patterns and the key factors of economic development in autocracies.  In the project, she formed a game-theoretic model of the dynamics of political regime transition and economic development simultaneously. 

Aya has leapt into our program with great excitement and has impressed everyone with her keen insights and strong skills.  She was simply amazing in our quantitative courses.  In addition to our sequence and all her previous training at Duke, she has also taken Charles Franklin‚??s maximum likelihood course (ICPSR), advanced game theory, and event history analysis with Jan Box-Steffensmeier (through our ITV program).

Though she is just in her second year with us, she already has a well-developed idea for her dissertation.  She plans to study regime transition and political networking under authoritarianism.  The project focuses on revolution and regime transition under authoritarianism. This study asks why revolutions occur.  Why do some revolts successfully lead to regime transitions?  The puzzle is how opponents of the regime overcome the collective action problem.  Various explanations have been provided in the existing literature of democratization; however, these studies typically ignore the dynamics that lead to the emergence of revolts, which in my conceptualization are networks resulting from individuals‚?? efforts to find secret allies.  Here she utilizes social network analysis to conceptualize social movements as networks of the repressed who hope for regime transition and define ‚??successful‚?ù revolution (that leads to regime transition) as a network that reaches a critical mass without being suppressed by the incumbent government.  She also plans to use agent based modeling to understand the workings of social networks under autocracy and test the hypotheses generated by the ABM with real world data (the macro-level data in the short-run, and the actual micro-level network data in the long-run, from the Eastern European countries.) 

I have no doubt that Aya will emerge as a great scholar.  There are not many visible female and minority graduate students in the polmeth group, but I firmly believe that Aya will add to the small group of distinguished female and minority scholars.  She does first-rate work, is extremely hard working, and has the skills to really excel in this field.  It is a testament to the polmeth group that they are often able to identify talent early, and I hope that you will invite Aya to the meetings and prove once again that we are a group who has an amazing ability for identifying the young and most capable up and coming scholars in our field.  Aya clearly fits in this group.

I am writing to express my very strong support for Mike Kellermann's application to the 2007 summer methods meeting. I have known Mike for about 3 and a half years now and I know him well. Let me go directly to the bottom line-- Mike is the strongest graduate student in the Harvard Government Department. He is among the top two or three graduate students who will be applying to the 2007 summer meeting. He should *absolutely* be allowed to attend. 

I have had Mike in two classes-- one an introductory regression class and the other a much more advanced Bayesian inference class. Mike was easily the top student in both classes. This is all the more impressive given that the Bayesian inference course had Ph.D. students from Harvard Statistics and MIT Cognitive Science in the class. Mike grasps things very quickly, has excellent mathematical skills and mathematical maturity, and really cares deeply about the substantive side of political science. 

Mike's dissertation is a comparative project that makes use of formal theory and quantitative empirical evidence to gain traction on the important issue of party formation and party development. I have no doubt that this will be an important contribution to comparative politics and will likely also provide advances in applied formal theory and quantitative methodology. 

Mike also served as a TF (aka TA) for me. He did a stellar job. He was extremely well organized, hardworking, and generous with his time. His teaching evaluations were superb (4.71 on a 1-5 scale). I couldn't ask for a better TF. 

As a second year student Mike won the graduate student poster prize at the summer methods meeting. 

If this isn't enough, Mike is also a tremendously decent person and a genuinely nice guy. 

Mike gets my highest recommendation. He should definitely be allowed to attend the meeting this year. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of additional assistance.

Kevin Quinn

I taught Andrew in an advanced research methods course this past fall 
and was impressed by his intelligence and work ethic. The course was 
demanding; it required that students learn to program in R, complete 
weekly problem sets, and conduct their own program evaluation as part 
of a take-home midterm exam.  From the start, Andrew showed dedication 
to learning the tools and the theory underlying the statistics of 
causal inference, and he worked hard to master the concepts in the 
class, most of which were new to him.  He proved to be amongst the 
most talented students in the group.  His performance was 
exceptional.  
 
In particular, Andrew's research paper for the class was illustrative 
of his commitment to expanding his knowledge of methodology.  He chose 
to replicate an existing study, but the replication required that he 
learn multiple imputation techniques and a number of non-parametric 
statistical tests.  Though the project was challenging, Andrew took it 
upon himself to study these concepts and produced an excellent paper. 
 
Andrew is a fellow in Berkeley's Integrated Education and Research 
Training (IGERT) Program, an interdisciplinary fellowship designed to 
train a select group of graduate students in a variety of 
methodological approaches.  He was chosen for the award by a committee 
of political science, public policy, and economics faculty members 
because of his superb academic record and substantive interest in 
methodology.  Thus far, Andrew has validated the committee's 
expectations by excelling in his coursework and regularly contributing 
insightful comments at weekly ""workshops.""  In courses from 
econometrics to formal modeling and game theory, Andrew has routinely 
stood out from the rest of his class.  
 
More generally, I have been impressed by Andrew's intellectual 
curiosity and passion for quality research.  Prior to arriving at 
Berkeley, he was a researcher at a Washington, DC think tank, a 
position that acquainted him with senior policy analysts and sparked 
an interest in research that is both rigorous and substantively 
significant.  Andrew has brought this commitment with him to Berkeley, 
and his work reflects both his interest in important questions and his 
burgeoning technical expertise. His position in DC also provided him 
with the opportunity to present empirical research at a couple of 
academic conferences, experience that taught him how to communicate 
his ideas to a broad audience.  

Based on his intellect and experience, I believe that Andrew would 
make an excellent contribution to the summer methods meeting.  It is a 
logical next step in his development as a scholar of political 
science. 

Six Berkeley students are applying this year to attend the methods 
meeting, and Danny is one of the two best.  Three of the six are 
excellent (Rocio Titiunik &gt; Danny Hidalgo &gt; Iris Hui): in the top 10% 
of students who have attended the methods meeting over the past 10 
years I've gone. And three others are very good (Amy Lerman, Andrew Kelly, 
Alex Theodoridis): in the top quarter of graduate students who 
have attended over the past decade.

Dear Selection Committee,

	It is a pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Ryan Kennedy.  Ryan is a comparativist who has training in both quantitative and qualitative methods.  He has already completed his fieldwork and has drafted two of the quantitative chapters of his dissertation.  He will be on the job market in the fall, but has not yet attended the Political Methodology Meetings.  

	Ryan is proposing work on the survival of regimes and selectorate theory.  He makes two primary methodological contributions to this literature.  First, he points out that the observations from the same country should not be independent, even if different leaders are considered.  Once he accounts for country-specific factors that might influence leaders survival by adjusting the standard errors, many of the variables highlighted by De Mesquita, Morrow, Siverson and Smith‚??s many papers, are no longer statistically significant.  Second, Ryan takes into account differences between democracies and nondemocracies.  This seems to be where the bulk of the explanatory power comes from, not from having a large selectorate and a small winning coalition per se as past authors have suggested.  His empirical results are well executed.  

	Ryan‚??s work has received recognition among our graduate students at Ohio State via his awarding of an AGGRS Award for his dissertation work and Distinguished University Fellowship. These are university wide fellowships that are very difficult to receive. Ryan has also received best paper awards.  His field research was supported by a Fulbright Fellowship.  

	I have worked with and assessed Ryan‚??s accomplishments through a variety of contact, including having him in class, reading his papers, doing reviews together, and serving on his dissertation committee.  Through such contact, I have discovered that his work is marked by an exceptional combination of virtues, chief among which are innovative ideas and excellent methodological skills. Ryan has already published four referred articles in Foreign Policy Analysis, Problems in Post-Communism, Europe-Asia Studies, and Journal of Political Science.

	Ryan has a thorough understanding of the quantitative methods he uses and creative ideas about methodological innovations. He is an excellent colleague because of his ‚??people skills.‚?ù  He is often found helping other graduate students in the computer lab with their code or other methods questions.  

	I fully support Ryan‚??s application to the methodology meetings.  I fully expect Ryan to be an outstanding scholar and teacher.  His persistence and dedication to his students, his work, and the profession are noteworthy. Attending the methods meeting offers an excellent opportunity for him to grow and stretch his methodological side.  It is excellent timing for him as well as a comparative graduate student who will be on the market in the fall.  

Sincerely,

political methodology summer meeting.  Holger has a very strong
commitment to the methodology field, excellent familiarity with
contemporary methods for observational studies, a range of challenging
and interesting empirical questions and an increasingly strong
foundation in econometrics and statistics.  He has an excellent record
as a teacher.  His general demeanor is thoroughly professional.  He
intends to make his career as a political methodologist and so is
naturally an excellent choice to attend and present his work at the
meeting.

I first met Holger during the fall of 2003 when he began the Ph.D.
program here at Cornell.  He had come to Cornell to study
international relations.  As a first-year grad student he joined his
16 fellow first years in the then-required Scope and Methods class
that I was co-teaching (with Jonas Pontusson).  I picked up fairly
quickly that Holger was exceptionally smart and creative, but with his
focus being IR theory I did not think about developing any kind of
longer term connection with him.  He completed the course, doing very
well, and I assumed that was the last sustained intellectual
engagement I would have with him.

Imagine my surprise, then, when in May of 2004 I received an email
message from Holger asking to serve as the TA for my fall
undergraduate course on Campaigns and Elections.  I had spent the
spring 2004 semester away from Ithaca on leave, so I had not kept up
with the apparent evolution in his interests.  When I met Holger
during a pit stop back in Ithaca, he explained that he had decided to
abandon IR and switch to American politics.  He told me he had grown
tired of the lack of precision, rigor and empirical grounding in the
IR field.  American politics attracted him partly because work in that
field had those features along with a wide range of potentially
interesting research topics.  Apparently I had had a bigger effect on
him in that first semester course than I realized.  All he lacked was
any history of course work in either American politics or political
methodology.  As of the end of May in 2004, when we were having this
conversation, he had taken a course on American foreign policy (during
the spring term) and was about to go off to Ann Arbor to spend the
summer taking methods courses in the ICPSR summer program.

Because the grad student in American politics who would otherwise have
been a natural choice to TA for my course had another commitment (and
supported Holger's plan), I signed Holger up for the TA job.  He
performed splendidly.  The TAship involved not only the usual grading
chores, but more important and more difficult it involved advising
students how to carry out the statistical analysis (mostly contingency
tables) of NES data most of them did to support their final papers.
There were more than ninety students in the class, and about 60 of
them did a ``short paper'' option that required them to do such an
analysis.  Holger had the primary responsibility for responding to
their questions about how to focus their topics, how to use the data
analysis server I set up and how to interpret their results.  The
students had good experiences with Holger's help.

The following semester he was my TA again, for a course on Public
Opinion and Public Choice.  A measure of the strength of his
performance there is that during the last week of the semester just
completed (Fall 2006), a student approached me to ask me about Holger
and to say what a fantastic TA Holger had been.  At the time, in 2005,
I had thought he did splendidly, but in retrospect clearly I
underestimated just how good a job he had done.

Holger is as smart and creative as I initially thought, and beyond
that I can say he has a thoroughly professional attitude and is likely
to be highly productive.  Since the Fall of 2005 he has been an
Exchange Scholar at Harvard.  His principal motivation for going there
was to take advanced methods classes on quasi-experimental approaches
to causal inference.  There is a unique concentration of people at
Harvard who are developing such methods and who teach about them.  The
Rubin causal model is breaking out now in a kind of methodological
revolution for political science (among other fields), and Harvard is
the origin.  At Harvard (and in a return trip to the Michigan summer
program) Holger has also invested in foundational courses in math,
econometrics and statistics.  Last September he took his Cornell
qualifying exam in methodology, passing with flying colors.  The exam
focused on his paper that applies observational methods to opinion
data from the former East Germany.  Holger is by now a complete covert
to the methods field.  You know what they say about the zeal of the
newly converted.  He will go far.

Holger has a sound plan for a three-papers dissertation.  Two of the
papers are well in hand: the media effects (East Germany) paper and a
paper on the effects unemployment has on political attitudes (Britain
and Germany).  He and I have talked extensively about how he will
carve out parts of his collaborative work on those projects to produce
stand-alone products for the thesis.  His third paper is not quite as
well pinned down.  It may be some work he is doing on panel data, but
he also has a few other projects that may come together sooner.
Partly that depends on data availability.  In any case, I have no
doubt that he will be able to complete and defend his dissertation by
the middle of 2008.  Hence I endorse his plan to go fully on the
academic market in methods in the fall of this year.

Holger has unquestionably had a more eccentric path to a methods
specialization than other students I have worked with.  Also he is
unlike other well known students of mine, in that I have not worked
collaboratively with him on any research.  He and I have talked about
that from time to time, but so far our substantive interests have not
overlapped sufficiently.  Plus I have been watching and encouraging
the observational studies revolution more than trying to lead it
(Holger is not really a fan of my more structural estimation efforts,
which is fine).  But I have followed what he's been doing very
closely, so I feel confident that his work is careful, thorough,
imaginative and sound.  If he tells me such and such is a result, I
believe him to be accurately telling me what the data have to say.
I'll be fascinated to see the path he takes.  I very strongly and
enthusiastically endorse Holger's application to attend the summer
meeting.

Hunjoon (David) Kim is an advanced graduate student in the political science Ph.D. program at the University of Minnesota, and is scheduled to finish his dissertation in May 2008.  He is a sixth year student who will be on the job market in the fall.  His primary area of interest is international relations, with an emphasis on human rights.  He has presented at several conferences, worked closely on research with several professors in the department, and attended the 2005 ICPSR summer session.   He is currently taking Jan Box-Steffensmeier's ITV class, Event History Analysis. 

David was a student in my Discrete Choice and Maximum Likelihood Estimation class in fall 2006.   The class covers methods for discrete outcomes, including binary, ordered, unordered, and count data, as well as introductions to limited outcome models for durations and selection bias.  David received an A in the class,  performing extremely well on homeworks and exams.   What stands out most about David is his intellectual curiosity.  David frequently asks insightful questions in class, displaying an understanding of the material and a willingness to think critically.  During office hours, after asking questions directly related to assignments,  he would often inquire about a variety of statistical issues not directly related to the course, but that occurred to him while reading a variety of substantive and statistical literature. 

His dissertation, advised by Kathryn Sikkink, examines the establishment of legal procedures for procuring transitional justice in response to human rights violations by the outgoing regime. His dissertation promises to be a very nice synthesis of qualitative and quantitative analyses of factors that determine whether or not a newly democratic regime institutes truth commissions or trials concerning human rights violations.  For the methods meeting, he has proposed the quantitative part of the dissertation, titled ``Why and When Do Countries Seek to Address Past Human Rights Violations After Transition?'' In this work, which he will present at ISA in March 2007, David undertakes three analyzes (using a Cox model) of the time until a country uses a truth commission, transitional trials, or other measures.  He also estimates a repeated events model for trials. In this paper, David demonstrates an excellent knowledge of the subject matter, demonstrated in the formulation of his hypotheses, the careful attention and justification of the measurement of the independent variables, and the careful selection of cases.  In his statistical analysis, he carefully interprets the results, demonstrating a clear understanding of the methods involved.  This research is quite promising, since it covers many more countries and years, and with more quantitative sophistication than previous studies.  

Overall, David is a very good student with strong methodological and substantive interests, who has completed some very interesting and important research.  His paper would be an excellent selection for the political methodology poster session. 

If you have any questions concerning David, feel free to contact me. 

Sincerely,

In addition, at Arizona State University, our graduate program offers students a rich background in qualitative methods.  Because I use both qualitative and quantitative methods, I can facilitate our focus on methods more broadly.  I currently teach undergraduate methods, and plan to develop a graduate level course focusing on TSCS and multi-level models.  Attending the summer methods seminar is key to enhancing my knowledge and skills in this area, and importantly, to develop contacts with a network of scholars who are also concerned about these issues.

I got to know Olivia Lau as an extremely conscientious student in my advanced
methods class, in her first year in graduate school. She was active and engaged,
often tutoring other students in the class. In fact, she got to know the statistical
models and R (the statistical package we used) so well, her nickname in class was
R-help! She came to us with good economics background and has been picking up
methods very quickly. She has the aptitude, interest, and skills, and she writes very
well.
Olivia is a coauthor with Kosuke Imai (a former student now on the faculty at Princeton)
and me on new statistical software, called Zelig (see http://gking.harvard.
edu/zelig), and is the coauthor of an academic paper related to this development.
The software is intended to be a fairly complete (open source and free) statistical
package, covering most major types of statistical inference. However, the software
is merely the implementation of the intellectual development, which is an ontology
of statistical models which makes possible a simple unified notation and syntax for
users that can encompass a large fraction of existing statistical procedures, all without
requiring any changes in existing approaches. We conjecture that this idea can
be used to encompass and present simply most major statistical methods, regardless
of the theory of inference on which they are based, notation with which they were
developed, and programming syntax with which they have been implemented.
Olivia has been involved in every stage of design, execution, and documention of this
work, and as a result has gained a deep and extremely broad understanding of a wide
range of statistical methods. Throughout, she has been an equal collaborator. The
bulk of the first version of this program was written in her second year in graduate
school, while she was taking a full load of demanding courses and preparing for
general exams. Olivia made major contributions to the intellectual contribution of
this work, as well as the design and programming of the software, and she took
the lead in writing a 300+ page combination book and manual that documents the
statistical methods.
Now Olivia has finished her classwork and is making good progress on her thesis.
Her plan is to apply her technical skills to the relationship between (economic and
political) development and public health. A key aspect of this work is measuring political
freedom in a large sample of countries. Whereas existing measures of freedom
exist only at the country level, Olivia‚??s idea is to measure it at the person level and
study variations in freedom across countries. It is likely the case that the variation
in political freedom within some countries (including the U.S., with large numbers
of people in prisons for example) is as large as the variation across countries, and her
work would provide the first such description of this important empirical pattern.
She has already shown that a disproportionate amount of the variation in political
freedom across developing countries occurs in the treatment of women, in that treating
women like men would eliminate most and in many cases all of the aggregate
differences. In this work, she has access to a unique survey of many countries with
better measures of political and health variables than has been possible previously,
and she is using sophisticated methods to avoid problems of different respondents
interpreting the same questions in different ways. In my view, this is likely to be a
important study that will have a serious impact on the literature.
Olivia has now finished two chapters of her thesis and I think has an excellent chance
of finishing the thesis next year.
Please let me know if I can provide any additional information.
Sincerely,
~~

Summer Methods Program
Pennsylvania State University

Dear PSU Colleagues:

This is a recommendation on behalf of Ben Lauderdale, a second-year grad student here.  I am Ben‚??s advisor and comprehensive paper supervisor.  He is taking his second course with Larry Bartels and myself.  I know him very well.

Ordinarily I don‚??t recommend a second-year student for the Summer Meetings.  But Ben is an exception.  This is a Harvard undergrad who came to us with considerable statistical training.  He has been a star in our methods sequences, which he began at the second-year level and is now taking our third-year courses.  He is ready for the Summer Meeting.

His current work is on scaling roll calls with heteroskedastic errors, but he has done a number of other interesting things as well.  He uses MCMC, for example, doing his own programming in R.  He has considerable formal theory background, so that the EITM approach is second nature to him.  And the work is not mindless technical stuff‚??the political insights and historical context are all there.  He is as sure a bet to be a prominent political methodologist as any second-year student can be.

I recommend him to you with great enthusiasm.

	B.J. came to UT with two M.A.'s in political science, the first from Yonsei University in Korea, the second from the University of Washington, and has been doing splendidly at UT.  For my part, I have had him in two courses, one substantive (comparative political behavior) and one methodological (simultaneous equation models), and have been helping him develop his dissertation proposal.  His work and interests display a striking mix of the philosophical, the empirical, and the technical (both statistical and game-theoretic).  

	I have long known from all this that B.J. was a very good student but have lately been discovering just how good.  A couple of months ago he sent me a very rough draft prospectus that simply blew me away.  He cogently limned several interesting, insightful, and technically impressive analyses.  The draft's only major weakness, if you could call it that, was that it was ""too much.""  There was enough material to lay the foundations for two or three first-rate dissertations.  He is therefore now working on narrowing the proposal--setting aside the discards for side- or post-dissertation projects.  

	The dissertation will concern ""transitional justice"":  the treatment of former dictators and human rights violators in newly democratic regimes.  B.J. is particularly interested in the effects of ""truth"" (viewed as individual recognition of past abuses) on ""reconciliation"" (viewed as encompassing political, racial, ethnic, and religious tolerance; support for human rights; and acceptance of the new, democratic institutions).  He is also interested in identifying the conditions under which Truth and Reconciliation Commissions succeed in promoting reconciliation in these various respects.  I expect him to defend his dissertation prospectus sometime later this spring and then to progress rapidly on the dissertation itself.

	Among the hivings-off from the original draft prospectus, by the way, are analyses, based on both formal and statistical models, of the factors causing states to adopt the transitional justice measures they do.  B.J. already has a paper, and some interesting results, on this score, relating the harshness of transitional justice measures to the strength and abusiveness of the former regime and to GDP, among other things.  I expect this work to form the basis of an article or two in the reasonably near term and of his second book in the further future.  

	B.J. is doing all the right things to prepare himself for a successful career.  He has been attending the major professional conferences.  This April he will be presenting a paper on ""The Elusive Role of Public Opinion in Transitional Justice Implementation"" at the Midwest.  Last summer he attended the EITM summer camp at Washington University in Saint Louis.  At UT, he has continued taking and auditing courses in advanced statistical and formal modeling, mostly in the Economics Department.  David Crow, for whom I am also writing, has as much, perhaps even more, talent, but B.J. may well be, at this moment, the most technically proficient of all our Ph.D. students. (And may well remain so.  The way he keeps working at it, he will be hard to catch.)

	B.J.'s poster proposal, related to his dissertation, is on ""The Causal Effects of (No) Punishment on Democratic Consolidation: Lessons from Matching.""  As the subtitle suggests, the poster/paper revolves around a matching estimation.  B.J. has cobbled together, from various sources, an impressive country-level data set relating to transitional justice.  The problem is that meaningful transitional justice measures, apart from amnesty, are rare.  Thus he turns to propensity score matching based on a genetic search algorithm, coupled with data augmentation.  He also compares his matching results with those from both linear regression and Heckman selection models.  

	In all, B.J. is clearly among the best in his cohort in our program--extremely intelligent, hard-working, highly focused, and well socialized professionally.  He writes somewhat unidiomatically but clearly and concisely in English.  He has wide substantive knowledge and a nose for important topics.  He enriches his work with his knowledge of strong philosophy.  And, most importantly, in the present connection, he has enormous technical strengths.  He is in the process of becoming a methodologist among methodologists.  

	If B.J. were an American, with native English, I'd consider him not unlikely to land a job in a top ten or twenty department and become a major figure in his fields.  He may anyway.  As I say, his draft dissertation proposal (in its un-narrowed form) contains the seeds of several prime time projects, and he continues to build on his technical strengths.  I recommend him very strongly for the SPM summer conference.","Luskin","Robert","Assoc. Prof./Visiting Assoc.

As his dissertation advisor, I have advised Han Soo to attend this conference to obtain exposure to methodological perspectives that are not available in our graduate program. With respect to Han Soo‚??s qualifications, he is among the best graduate students I‚??ve supervised while at Texas A&M.  He has done exceedingly well in his methods courses, including econometrics, game theory, maximum likelihood, and time series. Because of this preparation, he should be intellectually prepared to benefit from the conference. 

His substantive field is American political institutions and behavior, and he has a strong grasp of this field. I know this must seem unusual for an Asian student, but it really is true. I would expect his poster to be well received, since it contributes to understanding of the determinants of economic voting and the factors that condition these effects. 

More generally, Han Soo is an impressive individual who takes great pride in his work and continually strives to fulfill his potential.  I believe that he will represent Texas A&M well at the conference and be a positive investment for the methods group for the future. I gladly give him my highest recommendation.

the 2007 Summer Methods Meeting.  Amy is a 5th year graduate student 
in the Department of Political Science at the University of 
California, Berkeley. 
  
I came to know Amy as a student in my advanced methods course, 
""Statistics of Causal Inference in the Social Sciences.""  The course 
was part of a National Science Foundation IGERT series, and Amy is one 
of the fellows in the selective IGERT program.  I found her to be an 
enthusiastic and engaged student.  In the months since the course 
concluded, I have consulted on her dissertation project, and have been 
consistently impressed by the scope and rigor of her 
scholarship. 
 
Amy's work takes a creative and innovative methodological approach to 
address an important public policy question: how does incarceration 
impact social and political attitudes?  Using multivariate matching 
and regression discontinuity, her dissertation project makes use of 
the fact that California prisons vary significantly by security level 
and prison culture, and that, conditional on a set of characteristics, 
inmates are essentially assigned at random to a particular prison 
facility.  The strong research design of the project promises to 
provide an excellent example of how natural experiments can be 
exploited to get at a causal effect. 
 
The project is an ambitious one, and is only made possible by her 
exceptional background in the substantive areas of political behavior, 
social psychology and criminology.  As an instructor at San Quentin 
State Prison over the past five years, she has gained first-hand 
knowledge of how the prison system works.  She has also been able to 
cultivate relationships with key stakeholders in California's 
correctional system, often despite their initial hesitancy to engage 
with outside researchers.  This has provided her with extraordinary 
access to data, and to the inmates, officers and managers who live and 
work inside the state's prisons.   
 
As part of the dissertation project, Amy successfully designed and 
completed a state-wide survey of correctional officers, which 
ultimately yielded about 6,000 respondents.  This project alone could 
constitute a dissertation, in that it provides unique insight into the 
bureaucratic norms, problems and conditions faced by custody officers 
in the state of California. 

She has also obtained a data file on a large sample of current 
offenders paroling from all 33 of the state's prisons.  This provides 
her with data on her dependent variables, which include outcomes such 
as recidivism, psychometrics of criminality and social capital, and 
employment. 
 
Amy has the intellectual capacity and methodological training to 
complete a path-breaking study on this subject.  Moreover, the project 
promises to provide real answers to questions that concern a diverse 
group of scholars and practitioners working on issues of crime and 
punishment, social capital and political participation.  This is clear 
in the impressive group of organizations that have already provided 
her with substantial financial support for the project, including: the 
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; the 
California Correctional Peace Officers Association; the National 
Science Foundation, the Fox Leadership Center at UPENN; as well as the 
Institute of Governmental Studies and the Graduate Division at the 
University of California, Berkeley. 
 
I recommend Amy Lerman to the conference without hesitation.  I think 
that the attendees will find her work to be intellectually exciting 
and methodologically rigorous, and she will be a great addition to the 
meeting. 

Six Berkeley students are applying this year to attend the methods 
meeting.  Three of the six are excellent (Rocio &gt; Danny Hidalgo &gt; Iris 
Hui): in the top 10% of students who have attended the methods meeting 
over the past 10 years I've gone. And three others are very good (Amy 
Lerman, Andrew Kelly, Alex Theodoridis): in the top quarter of 
graduate students who have attended over the past decade.  I 
should also note, given that some people seem to be interested in such 
things, that Amy Lerman, Rocio Titiunik, and Iris Hui are women.  And 
Danny Hidalgo is a Hispanic male.

He specializes in international political economy (IPE) and quantitative methods. He took my graduate game theory course and did extremely well. His dissertation examines the factors that influence the initiation and outcome of trade disputes, and when countries decide to pursue trade disputes in one forum rather than another. In the paper that he wants to present at the 2007 summer methods meeting, he examines whether foreign direct investment (FDI) causes trade disputes in the World Trade Organization (WTO). The statistical methods he uses are fairly advanced, and I think that the paper would provide stimulating discussion at the meeting, and would also provide Tracy the opportunity to get valuable feedback from others. Therefore, I provide him my strongest recommendation.

Dear Methods meeting graduate student selectors:

Jenna Lukasik has written a paper that will make a strong addition to the graduate student poster presentations at this summer‚??s methods meetings.  Jenna, a third-year student in the Ph.D. program, has proposed a paper for the conference that is co-authored with John Hudak.  Both Lukasik and Hudak both have strong methodological skills, as should be clear from their paper proposal.  I recommend their acceptance to the conference.  While Lukasik‚??s primary interests are clearly substantively based in American judicial politics, this paper has a strong methodological component and I think will eventually replace the extant measure of state court ideology.  Thus, I think Jenna should be accepted to the methods conference.

Jenna has strong substantive interests in American politics (primarily judicial politics).  She also has methodological interests in measuring revealed preferences of judges at the state level.  Without question, she is one of the most ambitious students currently in the Vanderbilt program.  I recommend her highly for the methods meeting.

	I taught Jenna in my methods course ‚??Topics in Political Methodology.‚?ù  In this course, I introduced and taught the students to a number of topics such as limited dependent variable models, event history modeling, TSCS and time-series analysis, textual scaling and multidimensional scaling, selection models, Bayesian methods, and other topics.  This course is the fourth in the sequence of methods courses at Vanderbilt.  We also spent a couple weeks on social choice theory, spatial theory, IRT models, and other EITM-type topics (though the focus was mostly on a variety of methods, and less on EITM).

Without question, Jenna wrote the best paper in the course.  In addition to problem sets, I require a final paper for the course where the students are required to use a method learned in the course.  Jenna chose to write a critique of the PAJID measures of state judicial ideology, which involved her new measure of ideology based on the revealed preferences of state judges.  To estimate her ideal points for state judges, she used Bayesian MCMC and IRT methods.  Even though we only spent a few class periods on ideal point estimation and Bayesian methods total, Jenna was willing to pursue one of the more difficult methods introduced in the course.  In the paper, she found that the extant PAJID estimates used in the state courts literature (which are static and based on state-level data about non-judicial elected officials and citizens) were invalid when compared to ideal point estimates garnered from actual decisions made by state judges on decisions.  For her paper in my course, she estimated revealed preferences for five state courts.  In the paper she has proposed for the methods conference (co-authored w/ Ph.D. student John Hudak), she plans to extend these ideal point estimates of state courts across all fifty states and across time and to use the estimates to assess other substantive questions of interest. 

In sum, I recommend her and her paper for the conference.  I think it would be very useful for Jenna to be exposed to more methods papers and methods experience, and this conference will help her do that.  Further, and more importantly, her paper is quite deserving for acceptance.

These are three of the brightest graduate students that have come through Illinois in quite some time.  They have a serious interest in methods and have worked hard on a tough and interesting question.  I could not recommend James, his co-authors, and their project more strongly.

I have known James since his first semester in graduate school.  He has been my student in the three graduate seminars that I teach ‚?? (1) democracy and democratization; (2) comparative political behavior; and (3) comparative constitutional design.  He has been my research assistant for the last two and a half years and a co-author on two working papers.  I am also a member of his dissertation committee.

In each of these settings, James‚?? performance has been nothing short of stellar.  He is a bright, articulate student who is deeply committed to political science.  His hallmark ‚?? amidst many other fine qualities -- is his almost superhuman productivity.  Indeed, he is perhaps the most efficient graduate student I have ever encountered either my teaching or student experience!

I was lucky enough to convince James, in his second year, to accept a position as a research assistant on a project on comparative constitutional design that I direct with Tom Ginsburg.  Tom and I now think of James as the third co-author and full-fledged colleague, as he has been involved in every aspect of the project.  This is a large data-collection project with a large team of graduate and undergraduate coders.  James has been indispensable in managing many of the day-to-day operations of the project as well as taking an active role in any questions of theory and measurement.  He is a co-author on two papers that have come out of the project.  We have plans for two more papers, as well.

James‚?? aforementioned productivity means that he has been able to take an active role in the constitutions project AND make steady progress on his dissertation, which promises to make a highly original contribution to an important question.  His dissertation focuses on the effect of the party system on turnout.  He describes multiple mechanisms ‚?? both complementary and competing ‚?? in which the number and distribution of political parties will affect the decision to vote.  His empirical approach, in which he employs experimental methods, cross-national data, and a clever sub-national design, allows him to disaggregate the various effects of the party system.  I am confident ‚?? more so than I would be for most any other graduate student ‚?? that James‚?? project will deliver on its very high promises.  

I should say something about the paper that James and his colleagues have proposed.  Each of these graduate students is working on a comparative politics dissertation and each has a deep interest in methods.  Their paper explores a topic ‚?? measuring democracy ‚?? that is central to cross-national empirical work in comparative politics and international relations.  They are quite familiar with the substantial literature on the topic and are committed to making an original contribution.  Their approach to the question follows directly from a widely circulated (perhaps now published) paper by Jackman and Treier.  Using insights from Jackman and Treier and Item Response Theory, the Melton, Pemstein, Meserve paper suggests a rather clever way of synthesizing multiple measures of democracy.  It‚??s a worthy paper that engages some of the best work in the field.

Very few Illinois graduate students venture as far as the methods meetings, although we have decided emphasis on quantitative methods in the graduate program.  James Melton and his colleagues are ideal candidates, who would surely benefit from the experience and contribute to the intellectual climate of the conference.

Please let me know if I can provide you with any other information.

Steve is currently completing his fourth year of graduate work.  He has distinguished himself as one of the top students in an unusually strong cohort at the U of I.  

I have known Steve since he entered graduate school and currently serve as his advisor.  Over the past four years, he completed several classes with me, including Comparative Political Economy, Comparative Political Institutions, and Introduction to Comparative Politics.  In each of these classes, Steve excelled.  He came to class prepared with comments and, more importantly, questions.  He has a unique ability to recognize the fundamental contributions of research and to raise issues that point the way forward for future analysis.

His dissertation research focuses on the political economy of epidemics.  Steve argues that the distribution of medicines in the face of widespread disease is a political issue.  Taking a cue from the political economy literatures on electoral cycles and partisanship, Steve argues that self-interested governments will influence the availability of treatments to benefit their constituents.  He is developing a theory that allows him to make predictions about regional patterns of the spread of disease based on the mode of disease transmission and the ‚??targetability‚?ù of different treatments.  In his analyses, he plans to include both historical and contemporary cases.  Steve is currently taking classes in spatial epidemiology to acquire the methods training necessary to complete the project.  

Steve is submitting a paper, ‚??Comparing Measures of Democracy: An Empirical Look at Scaling and Reliability of Eight Common Democratic Measures,‚?ù co-authored with two of his fellow graduate students, James Melton and Dan Pemstein.  In this project, they compare eight different measures of democracy and model them as a function of a single underlying trait.  This allows them to generate reliability estimates for each of them as well as allowing them to develop a new composite index that includes estimates of measurement error.  

This is a useful, informative project and an excellent example of student collaboration.  All three co-authors hope to attend the upcoming meetings.  But both they and I realize it may not be possible for all of them to get funding.  Therefore, they are willing to split any funding money among themselves if travel expenses can be provided for two or even one.  All three would benefit tremendously from participation in these meetings.  I strongly encourage you to accept their proposal.

Jamie is one of our best methods students. In terms of methodological skills, I would easily rank him among the top three students that I have encountered in the department over the past 12 years. In his company is Luke Keele (now at OSU).

Jamie has taken an unusually large number of methods courses. In addition to excelling in all of the methods courses offered by the department, he has completed the entire econometrics course sequence offered by the Economics Department and is now taking Bayesian statistics through the Biostatistics Department. He also has completed some methods course work in the Sociology Department, which is well-known for its quantitative program.

Jamie proposes a useful simulation study of the statistical properties of quantal response models. Prior simulations assumed that the models accurately captured the data generating process. This is a heroic assumption that Jamie calls into question in his simulation work. There he focuses on mis-specified models and ascertains the statistical properties of the quantal response estimators under these circumstances. The results so far suggest that the estimator behaves quite reasonable and better than a logit estimator. He is planning to extend this work by also estimating a selection model. The work is fairly far along and promises to be quite useful to scholars who are choosing between different models of binary outcomes in a strategic context.

In sum, I enthusiastically support Jamie‚??s application and hope you will invite him to attend the Summer Meeting. Should you have additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Letter of Reference for
Jacob Montgomery

	I am very pleased to write on behalf of Jacob Montgomery as he applies to give a poster at the summer Pol Meth meetings (co-authored with another graduate student here, Brendan Nyhan).  Jacob is in his second year in graduate school here.  He took the American core course that Mike MacKuen (at UNC, CH) and I co-teach, and he ended up earning the second highest scores in the class (second only to a Ph.D. student in Public Health!).   He‚??s as good as that result indicates.  Indeed, he is a very strong mixture of commitment to the substantive aspects of American politics, particularly mass behavior, campaigns, and elections, and of commitment to the more technical aspects of the social sciences.  I am very happy he came here (in a tough competition) and look forward to continuing working with him closely over the coming years.  I am serving as his advisor.  And, I recommend him to you most strongly.

Not only do I look forward to future collaboration, but Jacob and I have already begun working together.  He and I are teaming with Wendy Wood, in our Psychology Department, to investigate the application of recently developed models (by Wood, inter alia) of habituation and automaticity in information processing and judgment to turnout.  He was a clear choice of co-investigator in part because he has already published (actually in psychology, it turns out) and has a second paper awaiting publication.  We are giving a paper at MPSA in a couple months showing what I think is a rather striking finding.  (Jacob is involved in other substantive projects, as co-author, but I‚??ll move on to the more technical side of his work.)

	Jacob is currently involved in skipping the standard introductory year of graduate level of statistics to embark on the more ambitious goal of high-level proficiency.  To do this, he has just competed a calculus, linear algebra, real analysis, mathematical probability sequence that gives him the basic tools for serious statistical (and formal theoretical) work.  This summer he won the position of research assistant to our social science research institute‚??s new computer cluster.  To do so, he took a grad level course in computer science to prepare him for programming in the multi-tasking, multi-threaded environment.  This year he is taking the Bayesian statistics sequence in our Institute for Statistics and Decision Sciences (effectively our stat department).  His work with Brendan that he wants to present at Pol Meth is an outgrowth of that work. 

	An ISDS professor has been developing a new program (or perhaps it is an adaptation of an existing program, with MCMC in the first part somewhere), and they have been helping her with it.  As a result, they are currently in the position of using this spiffy, new, improved way to do serious Bayesian model averaging, and they have some very clever results, taking on conclusions that Latin and Fearon‚??s work on civil wars reached (and this is only one of their applications).

	All of this should, I hope, make it clear that Jacob is an extremely promising young Ph.D.  He and Brendan have a very fine project. I am very pleased to give him my enthusiastic recommendation for presenting a poster this summer.

Ryan Moore is a methodologically sophisticated student of social policy and political
methodology. He took my advanced methods class in his first year in graduate school
and wrote a paper that seemed likely to be published with relatively few subsequent
revisions. Ryan has now taken 10 methods classes in three departments and will
also receive an MA in statistics, in addition to his Ph.D. in political science. He is
serious, smart and thougtful.
Early on, Ryan worked with me to see the effect of new methods of mortality forecasting
we‚??ve developed on forecasts of the future of the social security system. As it
turns out, all the work that has gone into forecasting the future of social security has
been conditional on a single and highly simplistic method of forecasting (it doesn‚??t
even use covariates).
More recently, Ryan worked closely with me in a major evaluation of the new Mexican
health care system. We randomized health care to communities in Mexico and
Ryan was deeply involved in matching communities and in the randomization. Together
we developed a new method of pre-randomization matching, tuned to the
specifics of the case.
Ryan has made good progress on his thesis and the outlines of the overall project
are now very clear, and two of his three chapters are nearly complete. With the
right support, he will almost surely finish next year.
When Ryan graduates he will likely be one of the most sophisticated political
methodologists in his cohort. I would strongly encourage you to support his application
and to call if I can provide any further information.
Sincerely,
~~

I have known Clayton Nall since he took my class in advanced political methodology.
In that class, he developed a statistical model for city council racial composition
when different sets of groups are competiting for membership on different councils.
This is an excellent paper that I expect to be published. Its already on the program
at the Midwest conference.
Clayton has also worked closely with me on an analysis of a large randomized health
policy experiment in Mexico. He was heavily involved with developing and implementing
MCMC models, and at one point worked out the computer technology
necessary to reduce a run that would have taken hundreds of processor-days to
just two. He is methodologically very sophisticated, with a good deal of math and
statistics courses under his belt, even though he is primarily a substantively oriented
Americanist interested in American political development. This is an unusual background
in a field heavier on the jobs than the applicants. Although he is early in
his graduate career, it is easy to predict that he will do very well.
Clayton has also shown remarkable creativity in unearthing new forms of data. He
resurrected a 25-year old panel data of Air Force veterans that directly measures
many variables that prior scholars on the same subject have only hypothesized about.
He‚??s also done the same in other areas.
Clayton has my very strong recommendation. Please let me know if I can provide
any addition information.
Sincerely,
~~

Letter of Recommendation
Brendan Nyhan

	I am extremely pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Brendan Nyhan, in support of his application (co-authored with Jacob Montgomery) to present a poster this summer. 
Brendan is perhaps the most promising young Ph.D. student in American politics to come to Duke in my 19 years here.  He is terrific ‚?? smart, dedicated, enthusiastic, hard-working, ambitious in just the right sense, and a pleasure to be around.  He is the one person I would put my money behind (I guess technically, in some ways, I already have, and will continue to do so), and I recommend to you as strongly as I possibly can.

	Brendan came to Duke from Swarthmore (a double major in Political Science and Economics).  He got what I would hope someone would get at Swarthmore, a very strong liberal arts background.  He combined that with his obvious pleasure in thinking about politics to develop a deep interest in academic life, and in political science as a career in particular.  Part of what made his application so powerful was not only his formal training (with, obviously, an outstanding record) but also his ‚??side‚?ù interest, which led to publication of a book on political spin, to complement a web site (and a good bit of attention in the media, including a column in the Philadelphia Inquirer).  We pulled his application to our graduate program out immediately and put it on track for consideration for the highest award at Duke, the James B. Duke Fellowship.  He won that ‚?? something that a small number of the highest applicants to our program do.  One might think that with his stellar background, he would decide what he was going to do.  Instead, he sought out advice and took it eagerly.  Thus, he is one of a small number whom we have put on a special track for rigorous training in methods (meant generally to include formal modeling as well as statistical methods ‚?? similar to that his co-author, Jacob Montgomery is following, two years later).  It should be no surprise that his years here have been at the same remarkably high level of achievement as all else in his academic background.  The end point of this is that he is in the first set of Ph.D. students admitted to the interdisciplinary certificate program in Quantitative Social Science, and along the way has won a fellowship for this year from the Program in Advanced research in the Social Sciences (‚??PARISS‚?ù) through our relatively new Social Science Research Institute at Duke. 

	In addition to performing at a very high level in the classroom, Brendan has become an essential part of the Aldrich-Rohde research team.  He has begun to write academic research as well.  A year ago, he presented at the SPSA a paper written by our large team.  He followed that with presenting a paper on an experiment he and a former graduate student here have written.  This talk was at UNC, I attended, and it took me awhile to convince them he was not a new member of our faculty.  He has thus seriously begun to live up to his extraordinary promise.  

	He passed his Ph.D. examinations with distinction (the formal designation ‚?? he does everything with distinction, as you can see), and he has defended his dissertation proposal and is well launched in writing it.  It includes formal modeling, using new, advanced game theory that has just begun to trickle into high-tech economics, it includes sophisticated data analytic methods (in effect ‚??beyond‚?ù statistics, that is doing things that current statistical methods cannot address), but it also includes a lot of substance on the strategic politics behind the growth of potentially scandalous events into full-blown scandals (or, instead, those allowed to recede from public view).

This year he is taking the Bayesian statistics sequence in our Institute for Statistics and Decision Sciences (effectively our stat department).  His work with Jacob that he wants to present at Pol Meth is an outgrowth of that work.  An ISDS professor has been developing a new program (or perhaps it is an adaptation of an existing program, with MCMC in the first part somewhere), and they have been helping her with it.  As a result, they are currently in the position of using this spiffy, new, improved way to do serious Bayesian model averaging, and they have some very clever results, taking on conclusions that Latin and Fearon‚??s work on civil wars reached (and this is only one of their applications).

   	Brendan is a sophisticated and mature scholar who happens to be ‚??only‚?ù still in graduate school.  He is a splendid person and absolutely trustworthy in every way.  I recommend him to you (and everyone else) as strongly and enthusiastically as I can, for this poster, and, heck, for just about anything in scholarly areas!

I write to endorse strongly the application by Daniel Pemstein, a UIUC graduate student, to attend this summer's Methods meetings.  Dan was a Wash U computer science undergrad, and is very clearly the strongest methodologist in our program.  Indeed, in more than a decade here, I have seen only one other student who was on a similar plane in terms of quantitative skill (that student, Jay Verkuilen, made the unusual choice to follow up his political science PhD with a psychology PhD through the outstanding Quant Pysch group here on campus, and will join the faculty of CUNY Ed Pysch next fall).  Dan is highly skilled and very likeable, and he is a very good bet both to make positive contributions to the meeting and to gain from being invited.  The paper Dan is proposing takes a serious look at what content can be found in the various 'quality of democracy' scores popular in comparative in politics if one applies a more rigorous theory of measurement to them.  It strikes me as an overdue work, and I am confident the results will be of interest to many in attendance.

A word on the authorship of the paper is in order.  Dan is one of three graduate student authors of the paper, along with Steve Meserve and James Melton, and all three are hoping to attend the Methods meetings this summer.  Dan is the heaviest lifter in terms of statistical technique, but the other two are also intimately involved, and James is probably the author most plugged into the substantive literature to which their paper aims to contribute. Bill Bernhard will be submitting a recommendation for Steve and Zach Elkins will write on behalf of James.  All of us agree that it would be very useful for all three of these students to attend Methods.  We also realize that funding is not unlimited, and that it may not be possible for all of them to receive financial assistance.  The students likewise recognize that it may not be possible for all of them to be fully funded.  Nonetheless, if they can all be accommodated, they are open to splitting any award and paying the balance of their travel costs out of pocket.  I think they would all profit from attending the meetings, and I am hopeful that this will prove possible.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Most sincerely,

He took my Quant II (Greenish,
likelihood stuff) in his first year and got an A. I thought he would
be an excellent applied user, using really good methods to study
issues related to IR and comparative politics (building on work of
BDM). So I was surprised when he came to talk to me about bivariate
duration distributions. He pursued this stuff on his own, and did a
lot of work on estimating these models. While his intention is to
apply this to IR issues related to the joint survival of PMs and
Foreign Ministers (particularly as a function of MID involvement), he
correctly started off with Monte Carlos. Because the bivariate
distributions he is estimating only allow for a small amount of
correlation of the errors, the use of the complicated model did not
pay off as much as he has hoped. As you can see from his proposal, he
continues to investigate these methodological issues (and knows much
more about these bivariate families than I do), while at the same time
working with BDM on more substantive applications.

He is my TA in Quant II this semester and is doing an excellent job.

He would in my view be an excellent addition to the group attending
the meetings; he would both benefit a lot and his poster would be of
high interest. Amongst other things, he would also benefit from
talking to the excellent quant IR group at PSU.

RE: Julia Rabinovich, Northwestern University

I am writing to support the application of Julia Rabinovich to attend the 2007 Methodology conference.  Julia is in her 5th year in the doctoral program in Political Science at Northwestern University.  She came here after accumulating an excellent record from Tel Aviv University where she did her undergraduate degree and Master‚??s degree.  Julia specializes in American politics and Methodology, the two fields in which she passed with distinction her preliminary exams prior to being advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D.  In spring 2005, Julia was awarded the Department prize given annually to the best graduate student in their third or fourth year of studies.  Some of the past winners of this award have gone on to highly successful academic careers, and we expect the same from Julia.  I consider her to be among the most talented graduate students we have had in the program in the past decade.

Julia was an impressive student from the beginning of her studies at Northwestern. She arrived with a strong interest and background in studying survey research and political psychology.  She has since developed expertise in the study of political institutions, focusing especially on the workings of Congress and federal agencies.  She had broad intellectual interests in the social sciences and a knack for asking good research questions.  She did well in all of her classes and wrote some excellent research papers in the areas of political tolerance and foreign policy opinion.  She has subsequently revised a couple of these papers for submission to academic journals.  

Julia is writing her thesis on the strategic relationships among Congress, the bureaucracy, and the electorate in the policy process.  A great deal of research has focused on either the influence of constituency opinion on legislative behavior or the principal-agent relationship between Congress and government agencies. But there has been less attention to the relationship between public preferences and bureaucratic policies, a curious omission given the power inherent in administrative decision-making.  

Julia has formulated a strategic model of the conditions under which public preferences can exercise influence on Congress and the bureaucracy. The key insight she develops in the model is that the electoral connection between elected representatives and their constituencies can also lead to administrative responsiveness to public opinion because of the interdependencies across political institutions ‚?? specifically, Congressional oversight of bureaucracies.  She deduces from this model a number of predictions (based on the relative ideal policy points of Congress, the electorate, and the bureaucracy) about the precise conditions under which bureaucratic agencies will be responsive to public preferences.  These predictions are being tested using a combination of statistical evidence and case study analyses of Congressional-bureaucratic interactions in particular policy arenas.  Many aspects of this project are methodologically challenging because it is difficult to obtain reliable indicators of the policy preferences of key actors in her model.  Therefore it is impressive that she has devised several innovative and promising ways to overcome these measurement problems. She has gathered data from a variety of sources including National Election Studies survey data on public preferences, legislative roll-call voting data on members of Congress, and data from the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations on the legislative priorities of selected government agencies and the general public. 

Julia is concentrating her analysis in two policy realms:  foreign trade and state telecommunications regulatory policies.  She is applying to NSF for a research grant to gather survey data in the 50 states on the public‚??s attitudes toward and knowledge of telecommunications regulatory policies.  These data will be combined with data on the median preferences of state legislators (based on legislative roll call data that have been compiled by other researchers) and newly collected survey data on the policy preferences of state public utility commissioners to test her predictions about the conditions under which the electorate‚??s preferences influence telecommunications policy.  

The project is feasible and well designed, and the resulting analysis will constitute a seminal contribution to our understanding of the democratic responsiveness of government bureaucracies.  Previous studies of administrative decision-making have been elite-centered and failed to incorporate the potential influence of public preferences.  Julia‚??s study will thus be one of the first that constructs a strategic model of the interactions between the executive and legislative branches and the electorate, and tests the derivations from this model using empirical data drawn from different policy realms.

Julia is an outstanding candidate to participate in the Methodology conference. In addition to her academic brilliance and superb theoretical and methodological training, she is a very pleasant and friendly person.  She has been a dedicated citizen in the department who regularly attends workshops, helps with recruitment of new graduate students to the program, and generally contributes to the intellectual life of the department.  Last year she received a pre-doctoral fellowship year at Princeton University, a further sign of the high regard that others have for her research. She has my wholehearted support.  Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

Sincerely,

I think he's a great candidate.  To begin, I've known Robi for about two years following his admission to our graduate program.  In fact, he is simultaneously pursuing a degree in economics, where he also received excellent methods training.   In addition to our methods sequence, he's had three courses in micro (one essentially in game theory), two in public economics, and four in econometrics.  In political science, he took two formal theory courses, one of them mine.  In that class I found him to be an extremely perceptive, inquisitive, and intelligent student, quick to notice both logical and substantive gaps in the literature we were studying, including classic work by Calvert, Wittman, Alesina, Ferejohn, and Meltzer and Richard.  I am currently supervising his masters thesis.

	The thesis is related to his Methods Meeting proposal.  It was originally stimulated by an empirical puzzle:  the standard median voter model of taxation suggests there would be much more substantial redistribution than is generally found.  To address this finding, he has begun to investigate the impact of institutional structure on policy outcomes, starting with the fundamental observation that an institutionally divided electorate will produce different outcomes than do direct elections:  the median of the medians is not, in general, the population median.  He proposes to investigate this issue using a set of increasingly structured simulations, expecting that a key factor throughout will be the distribution of voter preferences.  The next stage of his project is to map these results into a more targeted analysis of the U.S. Congress to understand its impact on policy outcomes and their deviation from population medians.

	In short, I think Robi is a great candidate for the Methods meeting.  I expect that he will profit greatly from this meeting, and those with whom he interacts will profit as well.  Please contact me if you need any additional information.","Grafstein","Robert","professor","University of Georgia","bobgraf@uga.edu","706.542.4147","received","3734","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2007-04-17","0000-00-00","","","","","2007-04-18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","Complete"

Mark Ramirez has asked me to recommend him for the methods meeting and I do so enthusiastically.  Mark is, without a doubt, the best graduate student A&M has ever had.  While I have only been here six years, I know I can say this because it is the consensus view of the faculty I have talked about it with here.  He is as smart as they come, unbelievably hard working, has shown real aptitude at methods, and asks important theoretically motivated questions.  His talents and work ethic are what lead Paul Kellstedt, Guy Whitten and I to ask Mark to be the editorial assistant for TPM.  He is also a great guy.  He is one of those graduate students that you really enjoy having around and will miss when he leaves.  He is a precisely the kind of student that would benefit from his experience at methods meeting.
Mark showed up at A&M completely prepared for graduate school.  He had taken graduate seminars from Paul Goren (now at the University of Minnesota) and Kim Fridkin while an undergraduate at Arizona State.  I was struck during his recruitment visit here by how intellectually mature and creative he was.  During our chat while he was here he pitched a paper idea to me for an original experiment testing theories of distributive justice and support for political institutions.  After he arrived, I helped him through the institutional review process to get the study approved and double checked some of his question wording, but Mark took the complete responsibility for this paper.  The experiment turned out beautifully, though it has been facing some difficulty in the review process (someone had the same basic idea and a two year head start on Mark).  He is also part of two other projects with me and has other faculty lining up to work with him.  I expect that Mark will have several publications in top journals to his name when he goes on the market.
His performance in seminars has been unparalleled.  He not only reads all of the required and recommended readings for a week, he often reads other work cited in those readings to make sure he fully understands all of the literature.  He is engaged in class, asking the best questions and pushing his fellow students to move beyond petty details and think theoretically.  His writing was good when he arrived.  He has taken gain effort to improve it, asking as many faculty members to read his work as possible.  
His methods skills are also easily the best I have seen here, and I have taught most of the students who have come through here over recently.  Part of this is that Mark gets it.  He knows the importance of sound methods and has taken every class possible at A&M on the topic including two classes in regression (taught using Gujarati and Greene), an experimental methods course, time series, maximum likelihood, and game theory.  He spent last summer at ICPSR taking coursework in Bayesian methods and Multidimensional scaling and attended the methods meeting last year at UC Davis.  
Mark is at an important juncture in his career.  He passed prelims last year (we don‚??t give high passes, but I am sure we would have earned it in American) and has been working on developing his dissertation.  I am Mark‚??s advisor and we have spent a lot of time developing different ideas for his dissertation.  Right now, I think he is frustrated.  Things have come pretty easily for Mark in graduate school and this is the first time where he has struggled.  I had the same experience in graduate school.  When I went to the methods meeting at UC San Diego, I had a loose idea that was underdeveloped.  Through several conversations with the faculty there and the poster presentation I developed the basic idea that became my dissertation.  This is precisely the experience Mark needs to have right now.  My hope is that Mark‚??s experience at the methods meeting, getting feedback from a broad range of scholars and getting their input on his ideas will help the same way it helped me.   
If you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to contact me at dave@polisci.tamu.edu or 979-845-6783.

Mark is currently working with myself and Micah Altman on a programming project to automate redistricting optimization on multiple criteria, such as equal population, compactness, and racial and political composition, among other crtieria.  The main program is written in R with calls to external C++ routines.  We are implementing optimization routines such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.

I believe that Mark would benefit from attending the summer methods conference.  He is a PhD student in George Mason's Social Complexity program and is also interested in agent-based modeling using similar optimization algorithms as the redistricting project.  For his professional development, it would be good for him to be exposed to optimization in other statistical contexts, such as with Bayesian modeling.  Other attendees would benefit from Mark's presence as he is doing cutting edge research on optimization.  I hope that you will favorably consider his application to attend the summer methods meeting.","McDonald","Michael","Assistant Professor","George Mason University","mmcdon@gmu.edu","703-993-4191","received","1459","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","50","Yes","2007-06-19","2007-06-19","","","","","2007-04-18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","50.00","payment_date = 05:17:06 Jun 19, 2007 PDT

Let me get to the point first: Daniel presented methodological research in the MAPSSS series at Stanford, which is a weekly speaker series with mostly faculty presenters from Stanford and elsewhere.  Everyone agreed that Daniel's presentation was the best of all this year.  He's really terrific.  

       Daniel is a terrific scholar, and his dissertation project is creative, interesting, and innovative.   

	Daniel is pursuing a PhD in communication at Stanford with strong links to the political science program.  He came here from Germany after receiving a master‚??s degree there.  When he arrived at Stanford, I was very fortunate that he chose to work closely with me, because he has been great talent.  He has terrific ability for quantitative social science, a tremendous amount of energy and tenacity, and a maturity about the realities of statistical data analysis that equip him to be a great scholar.  He quickly became the leading force on my research team and is the person everyone turns to for advice and help and inspiration as they do their own work.  

	When I became so-principal investigator of the American National Election Studies, I was given the opportunity to select a graduate student to serve as my research assistant for a four-year period, and I chose Daniel without hesitation, because he is so well-suited to the task.  As a result, Daniel has been working on many research projects with me, including a comparison of telephone vs. paper-and-pencil data collection (the study funded by NASA and involving reports of factual events by commercial airline pilots shows telephone interviewing to yield substantially more accurate data), a comparison of open-ended vs. closed-ended questions for measuring willingness to pay for public goods (a large telephone survey done in Ohio shows the methods yield largely equivalent results when analyses are conducted properly), a paper now in press showing the fatal flaws in a previous study claiming to demonstrate that asking college students questions about drug use increases their future drug use), and a hugely ambitious study showing that the order of candidates‚?? names on the ballot on election day influences election outcomes. 

	This latter work has been accepted for presentation at AAPOR this year, and it has already gotten quite a bit of visibility outside of the academic community, in op-ed essays in the New York Times and in the San Jose Mercury News, as well as in a story on Weekend Edition Saturday on NPR.  The reason for this attention is the amazing amount of work Daniel did in assembling and analyzing the largest dataset yet for studying candidate name order effects, involving every single election in the history of California in which candidate name order was rotated.  Daniel has been carrying out very sophisticated statistical analyses of this gigantic dataset (that he and our team of undergrads had to build from raw election returns in assembly distributes) and is showing that being listed first gained candidates more votes in 85% of the races we examined, including in many high visibility races.

	Quite apart from me, Daniel wrote a proposal to include new questions in the ANES measuring Americans‚?? perceptions of the abilities of political actors and institutions to shape the lives of ordinary citizens.  This work was a great surprise to me, because I had no idea Daniel was thinking about these issues.  His proposal, written on his own, was one of the winners of a competition in which the ANES Board of Overseers was able to accept only about one-tenth of the proposals.  And as a result, Daniel‚??s proposed questions were included in the 2006 ANES Pilot Study this past fall.  As a result, he has high quality national data to give his dissertation work an energetic start.

	As soon as Daniel proposed his dissertation idea to me, it struck me powerfully as obviously valuable ‚?? so obvious that it was amazing no one had thought of it earlier, at least as far as I knew and know.  We take it for granted that citizens assume their elected representatives have the ability to change lives, but perhaps (some) people view the world as so large and complex and government as very remote from them and from most other people.  Of course, a president can declare war.  But can a president change the trajectory of my own personal life in a meaningful way?  We have seen already from the new ANES pilot data that many Americans are deeply skeptical of this claim, thus perhaps explaining why pocketbook voting is not more common, perhaps why voter turnout is not higher than it is, and more generally providing insight into people‚??s thinking about just what government can and cannot do.

       In sum, I have the highest regard for Daniel as a scholar and believe that his work will be of terrific value for political science.  He would be a great participant at the PolMeth meeting.

Cory is an excellent presenter and has given departmental presentatons on methods (for example on the recent developments in the literature on simultaneous equations) and software (such as using R).

Dear Graduate Student Selection Committee, 

	I am writing in enthusiastic support of Anand Sokhey‚??s application to attend and present a poster on his research. Anand is one of the top three students I have worked with during my career. 
	
	As a reflection of the high esteem that he is held in at Ohio State, he was chosen to receive the Senior Fellowship in Methodology, which is part of PRISM (Program in Statistical Methodology) at Ohio State.  As part of the PRISM program, he provides consultation to faculty and senior graduate students.  He engages, pushes, and inspires the faculty and graduate students he interacts with to make their work better.  The combination of his ambition and hard work ethic results in very high quality work. Anand has been driven to work to be a broad methodologist.  He has interests and training in multi-level modeling, survival analysis, survey research/questionnaire design, and time series.  

	He is distinguished in the area of methodology by his intuition, which is built upon by connecting similarities across methods. I believe that Anand would get a lot out of the methodology meetings because he makes such connections.  Anand is also an excellent presenter and a participator.  That is, he will engage others at the conference.  By doing so, he will help maintain the vibrancy of the meetings.   

	Anand is one of Ohio State‚??s best students in terms of creativity. He tackles questions in the field of political behavior from a unique angle.  His creativity has captured the attention of various funders (seven separate sources for several different projects).  Thus, he has  collected original survey data for his dissertation.  He has published in Social Science Quarterly, two pieces in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, PS, five published or forthcoming book chapters, and has a revise and resubmit at the American Journal of Political Science.  He has accomplished all of this as a third year graduate student.

	It is hard to describe in cold prose the sense of excitement and intense energy that Anand brings to his research.  It is his excitement and energy that will result in his contribution to the meeting.  It is clear that graduate students benefit immensely from attending.  Anand will also be one of them that benefits, but also substantially contributes. 

Sincerely,

He has my highest recommendation.  Arthur is a methodologist's methodologist.  He eats, sleeps, and drinks statistics.  Indeed, he may be a bit too much of a methodologist (and not enough of a formal theorist) for many here at Rochester.  However, I have no doubt that he will soon be one of the core contributors in the methods community -- this cohort's Simon Jackman, Jonathan Katz, etc.  

Arthur already has four methods-related publications, including a forthcoming piece in _Political Analysis_.  All of his current dissertation and coauthored projects are methodological.  For example, his dissertation consists of three methods essays.  The first, which is currently under review, uses Bayesian techniques to identify change points in data.  (This piece predated Park's paper, which won the best poster award last year.)  His second dissertation essay extends this technique by allowing for multiple change points, with a posterior over the number of change points and their locations.  Arthur's third dissertation essay takes a new approach to estimating ""power"" among individuals, applying models of pairwise competition (Bradley-Terry models) to legislators. Using these, Arthur is able to estimate the relative power of the legislators.  

In addition to his dissertation research, Arthur is engaged in a number of coauthored methods projects.   He has at least one paper with Kevin Quinn on techniques for identifying voting blocks in the UK parliament.  He also has a coathored paper with Tasos Kalandrakis in which they estimate a structural model of dynamic two-party competition.  Finally, Arthur and I are currently looking at the problem of using dyads as the unit of analysis in international relations.

In summary, I cannot recommend Arthur highly enough for the summer methods program.  He is already a contributing member of the community.  This is a first-rate methods scholar that needs to be at the summer meeting.

To Whom It May Concern:

	I strongly support Piero Stanig‚??s application to attend the 2007 summer methods conference.  I have known Piero in two different capacities.  First, Piero was my teaching assistant for the second course in the graduate methods sequence.  Second, he has also been active participant in the seminar/class I have co-taught with Andrew Gelman for the past year and a half.  He is the top political science Ph.D. students I have encountered during my time at Columbia.  

	I have seen one empirical chapter from Piero‚??s dissertation where he investigates the impact of anti-defamation laws on the publication of Mexican newspaper articles uncovering corruption.  This study takes advantage of the variation in anti-defamation laws across the different states in Mexico to estimate how much the press was affected by these laws and how this effect varied by the type of newspaper.

This chapter was particularly impressive in two dimensions.  First, Piero spent part of the summer of 2006 in Mexico where he personally hand-counted the number of corruption articles that appeared in two newspapers from each state to insure the accuracy of the data.  The newspapers were randomly sampled from the set of newspapers in the Hemeroteca Nacional of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.  He is currently gathering the same data from Mexican newspapers on-line to do a longer time series analysis of selected papers.

Second, Piero used an impressive array of methodological tools to test the robustness of his results.  A number of tools he uses are self-taught.  For example, Piero spent part of the summer teaching himself Bayesian statistics since he felt these techniques would help him address some of the small sample size issues.  Despite the wide range of methods Piero employs he tends to focus on the results that illustrate his findings using the simplest techniques possible.  

Piero is a regular participant in several seminars including the political economy seminar, the comparative politics seminar and the seminar/class I co-teach with Andew Gelman.   He often makes very thoughtful comments and suggestions to the speakers.  I am often impressed with the range of Piero‚??s knowledge of various statistical methods, the comparative politics literature and facts about politics in specific countries. 

	I was very fortunate to have Piero as a teaching assistant.  He has an excellent command of the material covered in the Greene Econometrics Analysis textbook, which we used in the class.  He was very dedicated to the students and would devote many hours helping students outside his regular section meetings and office hours.  The students had great respect for him which was evident in the student evaluations. Having taught this class four times, Piero is among the best, if not the best, teaching assistant I have had.

	Please let me know if you have any further questions about Piero‚??s application.  I can be reached by phone at (212) 854 ‚?? 3704 or by email at sh145@columbia.edu.

Aaron came to Princeton with very strong quantitative background (BA in political science and MA in
computer science, both from MIT). As soon as Aaron arrived at Princeton, he took my advanced statistics course, which is normally taken by second and third year students, and was the best student in the class. Immediately after that first semester, Aaron and I started working on a collaborative project on ecological inference. Through
this collaborative project, I was very impressed by his ability as a methodologist especially when he solved one of the key integration problems in our project through the innovative use of line integral (and he was a first year student at that time!).  In addition to unusually strong mathematical and programming skills, Aaron has strong substantive interests in American politics. Before coming to Princeton, he worked as a data analyst at a polling company in D.C. Aaron has already published an article in AJPS with his MIT advisers, and is planning to present his work on presidential campaigns, which may develop into his dissertation. The summer meeting should provide a great opportunity for Aaron to receive feedback on this project from other methodologists and get to know them better. As
it should be clear by now, I think Aaron is the most promising methodology student who will come out from Princeton in a couple of years, and I strongly urge the committee to accept his application.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","4514","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2007-04-11","0000-00-00","","","","","2007-04-18","","","","","","","","","","Ovo-lacto Vegetarian","","","Yes","","","","","","","","","Complete"

Titiunik to the 24th annual Society for Political Methodology Summer 
Conference.  Rocio is on the road to becoming a top rank 
methodologist, and I do not say that lightly.  Her combination of 
technical (mathematical and computational) and substantive skills is 
extraordinarily rare.  I foresee her eventually getting a job in one 
of the best departments in the country (in either political science or 
economics) as a methodologist who contributes new techniques.  We 
should try to convince her to become a political scientist! 
 
Six Berkeley students are applying this year to attend the methods 
meeting, and Rocio is the best.  Three of the six are excellent (Rocio &gt; 
Danny Hidalgo &gt; Iris Hui): in the top 10% of students who have 
attended the methods meeting over the past 10 years I've gone. And 
three others are very good (Amy Lerman, Andrew Kelly, Alex Theodoridis): 
in the top quarter of graduate students who have attended over 
the past decade.  I should also note, given that some people seem to 
be interested in such things, that Rocio is both a women and Hispanic. 
Iris Hui and Amy Lerman are also both women.  And Danny Hidalgo is a 
Hispanic male. 

I first met Rocio last summer when I was interviewing several 
candidates for a teaching assistant position for my graduate class 
""Causal Inference in the Social Sciences"" in the Department of 
Political Science at UC Berkeley. Among the several candidates I 
considered, Rocio was not only the best prepared in terms of 
mathematics and statistics, but had also the most interesting 
background in the social sciences. Soon after she began to work for me 
I realized Rocio had a great potential for both teaching and research. 
On the teaching side, she confirmed my initial impression by showing 
great quantitative and methodological skills that were of immense 
value to the students. On the research side, our close interaction 
during this semester showed me that she had interesting ideas and a 
capacity for independent research. 
 
Rocio was originally trained in economics, which gave her great 
quantitative and analytical skills. As a PhD student in the Department 
of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC-Berkeley, she obtained a 
minor in econometrics and she complemented her quantitative skills by 
taking courses in the Statistics and Economics Departments at UC 
Berkeley. Besides her quantitative training, Rocio has interests in 
political science and in the philosophy of science.  She has taken 
several courses in the Philosophy Department, and she is currently 
taking a graduate course in the Political Science Department. Her 
research interests reflect this broad background, ranging from formal 
quantitative methods and epistemology to specific political science 
questions related to representation and the political economy of 
redistribution. 

Rocio has also great experience in applied empirical methods. In the 
past, she was hired as a consultant for the Mexican government to 
design and implement the evaluation of three large scale social policy 
programs. Her responsibilities in that project included the 
coordination of a large fieldwork in Mexico during the summers of 2004 
and 2005, the design of sampling procedures and questionnaires, the 
field implementation of the survey, the statistical and econometric 
analysis of the data and the elaboration of the corresponding 
reports. Moreover, from this research experience Rocio has a working 
paper that is currently under review in an important general interest 
journal. 
         
After her teaching appointment ended, Rocio became my research 
assistant. We are currently coauthors in a research project that uses 
redistricting as an identification strategy to asses the impact of 
candidates' extremism on voting patterns at the precinct level. In our 
interaction as coauthors, Rocio demonstrated strong research skills, 
including both sound theoretical background and great empirical 
proficiency. Also, she has begun a new project on her own which 
exploits a restriction introduced in the size of Brazilian's municipal 
councils in $2004$ to analyze both the impact of party concentration 
on the allocation of municipal public spending and the extent of 
strategic voting. Rocio would like to present this new research idea 
in a poster at the 24th annual Society for Political Methodology 
Summer Conference, which would give her valuable feedback from 
Political Science faculty and students. 
 
In sum, Rocio is an outstanding young researcher and I am convinced 
that her strong quantitative skills and rich background in the social 
sciences will be of great interest to the faculty and students 
attending the conference. Thus, I urge you to accept her application 
for the 24th annual Society for Political Methodology Summer 
Conference.
