Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Scott is a comparativist who has a great empirical dissertation
project.  He basically digitized historical maps of Europe for several
centuries and is now conducting a statistical analysis examining how
the size of states changes over the course of several hundred years.
As I understand it, the existing literature has many interesting
theories that are not being rigorously tested.  Scott actually shows
that many of these theories do not find empirical support in his data
and develop an alternative account of how the size of states shrinks
and expands depending on the external environment and its resulting
incentives.  In terms of his methodological training, Scott was
someone who came to Princeton's Ph.D. program with very little
mathematical background.  However, Scott is one of the hardest working
graduate students I've seen and has improved his technical skills over
the course of his graduate studies.  Now, he is using all these skills
to interesting substantive problems where many of his research
projects involve innovative natural experiments to answer important
historical questions (like James Robinson).  In conclusion, Scott is a
substantive researcher who is eager to learn new methods and apply
them to substantive research in a clever way.  I think he will benefit
from attending the methods conference - learning cutting edge methods
and interacting with methodologists.  At the same time, I also think
many of attendees will benefit from Scott; they will find his project
quite amazing in terms of its scientific significance and scope.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","3209","","","","","drivera@princeton.edu","","pending","8678","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-06-12","2012-06-12","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","148.5","","","398.50","mc_gross = 398.50

I am writing in strong support of Nick Beauchamp's application to
attend the 2012 Summer Methodology Meeting. Nick is a 6th year
PhD student at NYU.  Nick is one of the two most technically
adept and innovative students I have ever worked with (the other,
Adam Bonica, is now junior faculty at Stanford). Nick
has produced at least three original methodology papers in
his time in grad school. One provided the best accounting of
the shape of utility functions that I have seen. Another
adapts text-coding methods for ideological scaling in a novel way. 
And the third, develops a methods of text-based analysis
to estimate the effectiveness of television advertisements.
The paper he has proposed to present at this summer's methods
meeting is a fourth original paper.  

While analysis of blogs seems to be somewhat of a cottage
industry -- for good reason, they provide huge amounts of
text to analyze -- Nick is interested not just in WHAT people
are talking about, but in who is talking to whom, and more
importantly - who is trying to persuade who, and how? And he 
makes use of some interesting aspects of the data. Along with
providing text, he uses participants recommendations of other posts
as votes -- and can thus combine scaling data on the votes
(preferences) with the text of blogs.  
I have every expectation this work will be as strong as
Nick's other work. His preliminary analysis is very promising.

The TV ads paper develops the methodology to estimate the effect
of _individual_ TV ads on vote-shares, and performs a huge brute-force 
data analysis to estimate the effectiveness of over 350 individual
ads used in the 2004 US presidential election.  He does this by
regressing vote-share against each add separately, and averaging
over predictions to get the effect of ads. While the estimate
of any one ads effect is not necessarily precise, Nick does extensive
out of sample testing to confirm the ability of the approach to
accurately predict overall ad effect.  And after estimating
the effect of each ad on vote-share, Nick breaks down the ads to
their constituent components -- words -- and uses assorted methods
of automated text analysis to determine which words are most effective. 

This is the most sophisticated analyses of campaign effects I have
seen. And while it is one paper -- though a 76 page paper --  it would 
easily qualify as a large piece of a dissertation.  We learn the aggregate
effects of the ads Kerry and Bush ran, we learn what alternative
ad strategies would have netted each campaign  (i.e., what if each
campaign could more accurately have identified their effective ads
and used their resources to run those ads exclusively), and we learn
what sort of words are most effective for Democrats and what sorts
of words are most effective for Republicans. And, we have a methodology
for estimating the effects of television ads.

This is first rate, original work. I strongly urge you to invite Nick
to the methods meeting. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like 
additional information. [But do it by email or Skype, I'm in Italy
this spring and not paying much attention to phones.]

I am delighted to do so.  I have known Andreas since he entered our PhD program in 2005.  He has taken a handful of seminars with me, we have co-authored papers together,  and I am supervising his dissertation, so I am in an excellent position to comment on his abilities and promise.

Andreas is simply the strongest student I have had the opportunity to work with: his native intelligence is remarkable, his work ethic is excellent, and he has availed himself of the training available here.  Indeed, among the 
strong group of PhD students with whom I have had the pleasure there is universal agreement that they did not want to be on the job market at the same time as Andreas.  If you check with faculty here at FSU I am  confident that you will find the same story.  Indeed, just last week Mike Ward hired Andreas as a post-doc to work with him at Duke.

Andreas was a member of the Florida National Guard, and his unit was mobilized for deployment to Iraq in the summer of 2009.  There he served as his unit's Military Intelligence officer, and he spent the bulk of his time in Iraq
having to forecast the location and time of IEDs in the immediate area of his unit's deployment.  The value of out of sample forecasting is something I impress upon all of my students, and Andreas took it upon himself to go beyond the coursework available here to teach himself how to do it in a
specific research project.  Why?  Because he became persuaded that it made good sense to evaluate out of sample performance.

The poster Andreas will present is a chapter from his three essay style dissertation in which he uses the data collected by the Iraq Body Count project to forecast the number of civilians killed in Iraq during the US occupation.  Geographically he is working at the province level and temporally he is working at the level of the week. Andreas uses Bayesian methods and time series event count estimator he has been developing that will permit him to model not only the temporal dynamics, but the spatial ones as well.  I expect him to send me a draft of the paper in the next two weeks.  It is an excellent project that is a great fit for the student poster session at the Methods Meeting.

To conclude,  I urge you to include Andreas' poster in your session.  If I may of any assistance, please contact me at my office (850.644.6924), by email ({\tt will.moore@fsu.edu}), or on my cell (850.445.0392).","Moore","Will H.","Professor","Florida State University","whmoore@fsu.edu","8506446924","received","8092","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-06-10","2012-06-10","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","1","1","1","1","","","","","Yes","MM","","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","198","","","448.00","mc_gross = 448.00

Its easy to see that he’ll be one of the top people in the field in short order.

Let’s start with Matt’s thesis: It’s on causal inference in dynamic settings, as applied to negative campaigning in American politics. Matt is the first person to connect these two critical literatures, and as such I expect this work to be of considerable importance. Although its obvious from anyone involved in, or observing, political campaigns that strategy is highly time dependent and extremely interactive between the two campaigns, almost all statistical analyses explicitly or implicitly assume a single static intervention (like the administration of a drug once at the start of a drug trial). This of course is extremely simplistic and misses the essential dynamic nature and context of these contests. Real campaigns change the “treatment assignment” almost continuously during the whole campaign. Changing from one-shot to dynamic causal effects is likely to change many results in most empirical subfields of the discipline.

Matt has applied this work in American politics, but it is much more widely applicable. Consider one example from in international relations and comparative politics, where we look at the effect of a country being a democracy, do we control for GDP? The answer is yes if GDP is causally prior to democracy (because if we don’t, we have omitted variable bias) and no if it is a consequence (because we’d otherwise have post-treatment bias). Well, what happens if, as is almost surely the case, GDP is both a cause and a consequence of democracy? Matt has adapted the only statistical model every applied in political science that is capable of answering this question without either type of bias. This is very important work that will be followed and adapted and used by many scholars in many fields.

I got to know Matt the year before he entered graduate school, when as an undergraduate he worked with me and James Honaker, at UCLA. He helped us develop, and ultimately coauthor, a new version of our (Amelia II) software for imputing missing data. I have also worked with Matt in graduate school at Harvard on the same project, and a number of others we have started since. Together we generalized our approach to missing data to also deal with problems of measurement error. Matt took a major intellectual role in pushing this project forward. At first, he wrote the code to do the simulations; now, he is a complete equal on the project in every way, doing some of the derivations, providing real conceptual insight, and suggesting new directions for the work.

Matt has shown himself to be one of the rare students who is able to compete at the highest levels in statistics, including a sequence of courses in the Statistics Department, and also in game theory, including courses in the Economics Department, as well as making important contributions to conversations in American political behavior to comparative political development. From very early on, Matt liked to collect research skills like some collect postage stamps. He programmed, in two programming languages new to him, a method we’d worked on for causal inference. He’s also reprogrammed our software for missing data in a more fully object-oriented style. He has shown the same interest in collecting skills in math, statistics, game theory, optimization, and some other areas. He’s an active, engaged professional political scientist competing with the best in the field.

Matt is also an accomplished teacher, earning very high ratings from his students as well as a teaching award — and that in the only required course (a methods course) in the Government Department. He gave the plenary talk at the annual meeting of the Society for Political Methodology, to rave reviews. Many said it was a like a TED.com talk.

Matt has just the right profile to make it in this discipline. He’s made a tremendous contribution to our local research environment, as I’m sure he would wherever he goes. I predict more big things from him in the near future. (And check this space for updates!) I strongly support Matt’s application and encourage you to contact me if I can provide any further information. Best of luck in your search.

Sincerely,
~~

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Graeme will be the star in the comparative politics job market either
this fall or the next.  He is a comparativist who studies African
politics and yet has received extensive training in quantitative
methods.  Graeme has served as a teaching assistant for my advanced
graduate methods course, has already published a political analysis
paper on list experiments with me, and has taken a lead role in
writing the R package that implements the methods we developed to
analyze list experiments.  Graeme and I are working on a few more
papers and he is also coauthoring several other papers with other
faculty members such as Jake Shapiro and Betsy Paluck.  His
dissertation, which is about natural resources and conflicts, is quite
impressive.  Graeme has gathered an original data set about the
location and timing of oil discoveries over last several decades in
Nigeria and is examining how they influence the onset of local
conflicts.  His empirical findings reverse many of the existing
theories: it turns out that the discovery of oil reduces the
likelihood of conflict in that region but increases it outside of the
area.  Graeme has a neat theory to explain this and other
counter-intuitive findings.  He is also conducting survey experiments
in Nigeria, which are funded by the grant we received from the
U.K. government.  In sum, Graeme is a very promising comparativist
with methodological skills that parallel with those of many young
methodologists.  Given that comparativists are increasingly using
experiments and other methodologically sophisticated techniques, the
methodology society will need someone Graeme who can bridge between
political methodology and the substantive subfield.   He has my
strongest support and I strongly encourage the selection committee to
give him an opportunity to present his work at the summer meeting.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","7946","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","8895","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-06-05","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","MM","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

Dear Members of the Selection Committee,
Polmeth Summer 2012 
//

 It is with great pleasure that I write this letter to enthusiastically endorse Kiyoung Chang’s application to the 2012 Summer Methods Meeting. He is a brilliant graduate student with a very sophisticated research agenda, clear theoretical goals, and top quantitative training. He will be a great addition to your program, presenting state-of-the-art research that will be of interest to Methods scholars as well as methodologically savvy researchers in fields of IR, Comparative, and American Politics.

  Kiyoung is without a doubt the most sophisticated graduate student I have met in a long time and the top methods student at the University of Maryland. He is theoretically insightful and has great programming skills to quickly translate his intuitions into sensible research agendas. He is currently the TA for the Advanced Multilevel Models graduate seminar I teach at UMD and we are also collaborating on a research paper with my colleague Timothy Hellwig (Indiana University). 
 
  While I am currently engaged in a research project with Kiyoung, he has an exciting research agenda of his own that he hopes to present at the next summer meeting. In this research project, he is estimating ideal points using dyads rather than individual votes, borrowing from network analysis and scaling techniques. This is exciting new research, with the potential to draw meaningful ideal point estimates in highly dimensional data. In effect, rather than estimating the location of individuals in the latent space, Kiyoung proposes a technique to scale overall affinity between each pair of individuals (countries). This strategy effectively folds many dimensions onto a single agreement score and transform the ability parameter of standard IRT models into descriptors of overall inter-country agreements by vote. 

  Kiyoung has an outstanding first version of this paper, and the feedback from the Summer 2012 Polmeth meeting will allow him to revise and submit this paper for publication. Kiyoung is the kind of student that will both contribute and greatly benefit from participating in this meeting. It is therefore with great pleasure and no reservations that I wholeheartedly support Kiyoung Chang’s application. If you need further information please do not hesitate to contact me at my e-mail address ecalvo@umd.edu or by phone at (832) 276-7890.

Han Il Chang is one of our most valuable phd students and has performed excellently in classes and in his research.  His poster would report on originally designed experiments he conducted testing the extent that motivations such as negative and positive reciprocity are a mechanism by which candidates are able to use clientelism to secure votes even when ballots are secret (that is voting behavior cannot be observed).  Essentially, Han Il demonstrates that some voters vote for a candidate that they do not prefer in return for a promised transfer of resources as a quid pro quo (positive reciprocity), while others vote against a candidate they prefer when they anticipate that the candidate will not give them a promised transfer as a quid pro quo (negative reciprocity).  These behaviors occur even when voting choices are not always measurable by candidates.  While many have theorized that quid pro quo behavior explains clientelism, most argue that observability of voting behavior is a requirement for the quid pro quo behavior to work, which Han Il shows is not always true because of motives of positive reciprocity.  Furthermore, Han Il's finding that negative reciprocity supports clientelism and can explain why candidates may provide transfers even to those who should vote for them due to their preferences, even when voting behavior is not observed, is a new result that adds a previously unknown explanation for how clientelism works.  His paper thus provides new theoretical and empirical understanding of clientelism using experimental methods.  I hope you will accept his poster for presentation and support at the meetings.

I am pleased to write this letter in support of Olga Chyzh’s application for the 2012 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Chyzh in two of my methods classes and am currently co-advising her dissertation. I would place her among the top 2 or 3 graduate students in methods in our department. 

In addition to doing excellent work in classes she took with me, Chyzh has been hard at work at what will be an excellent dissertation. It focuses on international connectedness between countries by applying social network analysis to interstate relations with the goal of not just measuring characteristics of international networks, but of simultaneously modeling the process through which they emerge in conjunction with various outcomes of interest such as democratization or improving domestic human rights. These processes are almost certainly not independent, so treating networks as exogenous and fixed likely misses some important parts of both interdependency and domestic decision making. I have been impressed by the speed at which she has taught herself about network analysis over the past year and then developed her own mathematical network model that simultaneously models choices about domestic institutions and international connectedness.

Testing this theoretical model clearly requires the use of advanced methods, both in terms of modeling the network structure, but also for addressing the possibly endogenous relationship between network connections and states’ domestic choices. The starting point for this analysis will be methods common to network analysis, such as a continuous-time Markov chain model (as in Snijders 2001) or exponential random graphs (as in Cranmer and Desmarais 2011). Chyzh has been learning about and applying these models over the past few months and will adapt them as necessary to her research.

Chyzh would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. She enjoyed the experienced last year and it has motivated her to develop a more methodologically-focused dissertation. She will be on the job market this fall and attending the conference would provide an invaluable opportunity to get feedback on her dissertation just as everything comes together. 

Please let me know if you any questions.

I’ve known Nathan Danneman for three years as a graduate student, research assistant, and co-author of mine. During that time, Nathan has demonstrated exceptional curiosity and independence and a penchant for unique, insightful work with a firm methodological foundation. 

Nathan distinguishes himself from his peers by his creativity and determination. Nathan has interesting ideas about politically relevant topics. Most importantly, he has the ability to see those ideas through by leveraging the skills he already has and independently acquiring new skills that he needs. This last point is critical in my assessment of Nathan: when he encounters research problems that are beyond his current level of abilities, he can independently those problems by teaching himself new skills---with a minimum of assistance from his advisors.

As a co-author, Nathan collaborated with me on a project where we develop a methodologically consistent approach to evaluating the substantive significance of an empirical result. He began by porting some code I had written in the R statistical language into a Stata ado routine. The program included a numerical integration routine and a Newton-Raphson-type root-solving algorithm. At the beginning of the project, Nathan had only a basic exposure to programming in R, no knowledge of numerical integration techniques, and no knowledge of the Stata programming language. I bought him a few books, described the basic procedure of the program, and gave him a few months over the summer in which to complete the code. Despite the many challenges that Nathan confronted in the project---mathematical, computational, and conceptual---he independently completed the assignment with only a few meetings and e-mails to guide him on a couple of sticking points. In addition, he is now a reasonably knowledgeable programmer capable of implementing basic statistical estimators in Stata. After this initial success, I invited Nathan to work with me on related projects; Nathan has proved himself a conscientious and capable colleague in collaborating with me on this work.

In his independent research, Nathan is interested in the influence that mediators can have on the resolution of intrastate conflicts. In particular, Nathan studies the selection of a mediator as a signal of credible commitment to the peace process. He argues that the peace process can be undermined by asymmetric information about a state’s intentions; some are seeking to negotiate in good faith, but others are seeking to use the negotiation period in order to build up their capabilities for a second round of warfare. Bringing a mediator to the table who punishes breakdown in the bargaining process can signal to the other state that you are serious about making peace. Nathan’s dissertation project studies this dynamic, including the nature of the mediator that states will select and the circumstances under which mediation will be effective at creating and preserving peace.

In short, I fully support Nathan’s application to attend the POLMETH meetings and hope that you will give him the opportunity to attend. I’m confident that he will make the most of this opportunity.

Very respectfully,

I am very happy to recommend Chris Fariss for Polmeth.  Chris was enrolled in my course on social networks two years ago and he has been working closely with Keith Schnakenberg on a project to apply network theory to the evolution of human rights over time in a variety of countries.  Chris also attends my lab meeting, “The Human Nature Group” and has visited me frequently in office hours.  I suspect he and I will publish several papers together in the next few years as we work together.

Chris is intensely curious about the complex relationships between human rights.  For example, if a government is willing to abridge the right to protest, how does this affect their willingness to torture?  Chris likes to show this nice quote from 30 years ago that says we will never truly understand human rights (and therefore how to protect them) until we take into account how the violation of one right can reinforce and make more likely the violation of other rights.  A human rights regime is a complex set of rules and institutions, a web of arrangements that is hard to understand without considering the big picture.

For decades, the effort to paint this picture has been primarily qualitative, with normative theorists doing the bulk of the work on human rights.  Quantitative scholars have been more reductionist, taking one piece of the puzzle at a time and searching for statistical insight.  Chris’s ambition is to unify both of these approaches by applying quantitative tools to a whole set of rights.  Fortunately, Chris started graduate school at the right time – in the last ten years there has been a revolution in network science and a massive effort to collect information that is just now allowing us to tackle the complex connections between rights for the very first time.  I am very optimistic about this project.  Chris has already discovered that the protection of women’s rights plays a critical role in the web of interactions between rights, and he is currently looking more closely at detailed histories of several countries to add deep insight to the results borne out by the network models.  The goal is to learn which rights are most critical to target for protection, and also to develop an “early warning detection system” that can be used to monitor current practices in countries at risk for human rights failures.

Chris is a deep thinker, and he is extremely interested in all kinds of networks. For his human rights project, he successfully adapted a complex procedure originally applied to product differentiation that was published in Science. This project really showed how strong his computer and analytic skills are.  In particular, I am struck by Chris’s willingness to cross disciplinary boundaries to do his research, reading widely in physics and economics while also deciding to work with a sociologist on his first paper to come from this project.

In sum, I cannot imagine a young scholar who would be more deserving of support this year than Chris Fariss.  His interests and his personality make him an ideal person to benefit from Polmeth.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions about this fine young man.

Dear Polmeth Conference Selection Committee:

This is a letter of support for Mark Fredrickson. I encourage you to fund Mark's participation at the 2012 Political Methodology Summer Conference.

Mark has improved my own work through his thoughtful and skillful computer programming: he is a co-author now of two packages for the R statistical software system (RItools for randomization inference and optmatch for matching both with Ben Hansen (Dept Statistics, Univ of Michigan) and he wrote an interface to Google Maps to allow survey respondents to draw on those maps (on a Canadian SSHRC funded project with Cara Wong (Dept of Political Science, Univ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Daniel Rubenson (Dept of Politics, Ryerson University)).

He has also shown wide and deeply considered interests in different substantive areas of American and Comparative politics: he is involved in a project on hate crime and political participation, and project on Black elected officials and the dynamics of turnout in the American South, and is now turning his attention to network affects among legislators and issues of representation and local and state government. He has just received his MS in statistics even as he excels in our own political science Ph.D. program. I think there are very few political science Ph.D. students who are equally interested in democratic theory, the nitty-gritty of American politics, and statistical computing.

Since leaving graduate school, I have seen many graduate students in their first few years in the political science Ph.D. programs at the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois because I teach them statistics.  I have also informally advised and read and commented on the papers of a few advanced graduate students at Harvard while I was there as a Robert Wood Johnson Post-doctoral Fellow. Mark is by far more grounded (e.g. he knows \emph{what} interests him and has a good sense for \emph{why} that arises directly out of his experience in political campaigns and his experience as a programmer for campaigns and non-profits) and far more skilled in the fundamentals of math and computation as a third year student than any other student in my experience at \emph{any} university in my experience (Berkeley, Michigan, Harvard, Illinois). He is also very ambitious and I expect this ambition to be a positive force enabling him to sustain concentrated effort on substantively important topics with lasting impact.

Mark is an excellent bet for someone who will meld high-tech computing with substantively interesting political science and thoughtful statistical work. I have encouraged him to attend the methodology conference. He shows every sign of becoming a methodologist. I strongly recommend that you give him this chance.

Sincerely,

I am writing in strong support of John Henderson's application for the 2012 Political Methodology conference. John is one of the best graduate students at Berkeley, and next to Luke Miratrix, the most important Berkeley student to invite to give a poster. He is a smart and talented scholar who has a keen eye for research design and for combining methods with deep substantive knowledge.

I have known John for four years in many different capacities. He has been a student in my graduate courses, I'm on his dissertation committee, and he has been a research assistant, and he is a coauthor on a paper currently under review. I know both his work and his research abilities well.

John is a 5th year Ph.D. candidate whose dissertation is on Congressional campaign communication strategies in light of changing party reputations. More broadly his research interests include: U.S. elections and campaigns, party politics, voting behavior and turnout, and research design and causal inference. Methodologically, he has written a series of articles on the effects of education on political participation. This is a difficult causal question to answer well, and John has spent considerable time and energy engage it.

At PolMeth, John plans to present work entitled ``The Behavioral Effects of Candidate Ambiguity in Polarized Congressional Elections.'' Using new data and innovative methods, John estimates the effects of candidate ambiguity on voter attitudes and behavior. He finds that increasing specificity in the campaign largely serves to differentiate candidates from their party on policy, and that this specificity generally benefits, rather than hurts candidates' election efforts.  HeI finds that partisan voters sometimes prefer ambiguous candidates, but that this effect is much weaker than that found in previous work.

John combines an all too rare set of skills. He has a deep knowledge of and interest in American politics, a theoretical mind, and strong methodological interests, which skew towards issues of design more than statistics per say. His research proposal engages a ``big question'' in American politics. His work is broad and engages important policy issues with the best scientific methods available in a creative fashion.  In short, I strongly support John's application. Please don't hesitate to contact me for any additional information you may need.

She has excellent technical skills---at present she's one of the two best students in her cohort at WashU.  While not being used in her proposal for the meeting, she also developed a great proficiency with the tools of text analysis and computational linguistics.  This type of analysis will revolutionize the study of judicial politics, and Rachael will be at the forefront.

Rachael is a terrific student, wicked smart, and will contribute a lot to the meeting.  Allowing her to attend and present will enhance her professional development, and she'll contribute a lot to the meeting.

I taught advanced method classes (Introduction to Multilevel Modeling and Bayesian Inference in Political Science) in the University of Chicago for five years and Kentaro is the best graduate student in political methodology.  

Kentaro is preparing a very original and ambitious dissertation in which he plans to develop a new game theory model and a new empirical model that explains when states choose to use force against other parties and when they choose to use diplomacy in international bargaining. In the method side, Kentaro develops a Markov-switching binary panel model to test his game theory model of crisis bargaining. In his Markov-switching binary panel, the effects of exogenous variables that explain conflict-generating processes are estimated after controlling for country-specific regime changes in the unit heterogeneity. 

This idea of the model is similar to my forthcoming paper (""Unified Method for Cross-sectional and Dynamic Heterogeneity"") but Kentaro's method is different in two aspects. First, Kentaro's model describes the regime changing process as Markov-switching while my models are based on non-ergodic Markov chains. The choice of Markov-switching process makes sense because Kentaro's game theory model provides a clear prediction about the direction of changes in parameters. 

Second, Kentaro implements the bridge-sampling method for marginal likelihood evaluation. Chib's method of marginal likelihood estimation has been known to have an error in Markov switching models due to the label switching. To my knowledge, the use of the bridge-sampling method for marginal likelihood evaluation is new to political methodology.  

Kentaro will present his model and method for marginal likelihood evaluation as a poster in the Summer Meeting. I have no doubt that his method work will make a huge contribution to the study of binary panel data in social sciences.

Thank you for your sincere consideration of Kentaro Hirose.

Best,

I write to enthusiastically recommend that Adrienne Hosek be invited to present a poster at PolMeth. She is a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley with a focus is on American politics and methodology. Her research examines the relationship between income inequality and voting behavior. In particular, she is interested in how the particular factors generating disparities in the United States change individuals' perceptions of their economic well-being and how these expectations alter the traditional models of income and voting.

At PolMeth, Adrienne has proposed to present work on new adaptive survey design methods.  To evaluate the influence of income volatility on tax preferences, Adrienne develops a survey experiment, which employs an adaptive design, whereby the order of questions changes based on preceding responses. This approach is particularly helpful when the type of information sought from respondents is complicated or when the researcher is interested in more than just the respondent's initial response without context.

More generally, Adrienne is developing new methods for dynamic information collection systems for use in online survey experiments. To better assess voter preferences over complex policy issues, Hosek is creating a new survey methodology that dynamically changes what questions are asked next based on prior answers. The technique applies the principal of greedy information gain to improve evaluation quality when conditions restrict the ability of researchers to perform lengthy, resource-intensive data collection and verification methods. The survey system takes a dynamic approach, generating a static but entropy-optimal question ordering that prioritizes questions which yield the greatest gains in information in the shortest possible time frame.

Adrienne would be a wonderful addition to the PolMeth poster session. Her poster will present novel methodological work on dynamic survey design an important substantive question, the effects of income inequality.

As the chair of Iliyan Iliev's dissertation committee, I am happy to
offer a letter of recommendation on his behalf. Iliyan is among the
best graduate students I have had in the last 10 years.  Iliyan has
worked closely with me over the last three years on a series of papers
and research employing time series methods and vector autoregression
(VAR) methodologies, mainly as part of NSF sponsored work.  In this
regard, I would rank Mr. Iliev as one of the top 5% of graduate students I have encountered over 10 years of doctoral instruction at the University of Texas, Dallas, at the University of North Texas, and at the Summer Program at ICPSR.

He is the first student I have had who has a project worthy of
presenting a poster at the Summer Meeting.  I also believe that
attending the summer meeting will greatly benefit his research since
it will allow him to meet and interact with other methodologists who
have similar interests in natural language processing to build
datasets.

Iliyan is very qualified to attend and benefit from the summer
meeting.  First, he has completed his coursework, which included
courses in Bayesian data analysis, time series, and maximum
likelihood.  Second, he is in the early stages of writing his
dissertation.  The feedback he could receive on his work at the
meeting would come at a critical stage in his project.  

Iliyan's project, the basis for his poster proposal, studies
endogenous, dynamic, and strategic behavior of members of Congress and
political action committees. His dissertation looks at how campaign
contributions and legislative rhetoric react to each other.
Historically this has been a difficult topic.  This is because looking
at legislation, votes or other legislative outputs as a cause or
consequence of lobbying and campaign contributions presented
measurement and timing problems.  A significant literature on the
rhetorical and financial contributions of lobbies has emerged on one
side of this analysis.  The other side has been much harder: tracing
the effects of contributions on murkier legislative influence and
outputs.

Iliyan's main scientific contribution here is two-fold.  First, he
has identified a granular way to gather changes in legislative
behavior by looking at committee speeches or rhetoric.  These speeches
are coded with a natural language processing algorithm. This gives a
fine-grained way to measure how legislative outputs --- serving as an
indicator ahead of votes or policy outcomes.  Second, he can merge
this with finely-grained, time series, campaign finance data.

I am writing to support Francesca Jensenius's application to this year's Summer Methods Meeting. Francesca is deeply interested in research methods, and she is committed to multi-method approaches. Her training at Berkeley has given her expertise in both statistical and qualitative methods. She would be a good addition to the summer's method meeting.

Francesca's dissertation is on the politics and effects of electoral reservations (i.e. quotas for underrepresented groups).  She explores the economic and political consequences of electoral reservations for scheduled castes (electoral districts in which only candidates of a particular caste can compete).  In other work, she is considers the effects of electoral quotas for women. The topic of electoral quotas has received wide interest by a variety of scholars across the social sciences.  A central claim in the literature is that descriptive features of who governs affect the type of public goods provided to citizens. Many argue that electoral reservations not only provide descriptive representation for marginalized groups, but that they also provide substantively better representation in the form of public goods and economic development.

Francesca brings a fresh theoretical perspective to the issues and equally importantly fresh data. For example, it is all too common on the work on India to assume that when a government bureaucracy says that some policy or reservations was determined randomly, to believe them because it is convenient to do so and because it is difficult to determine what the true assignment mechanism was.  Francesca goes through the effort to find out exactly how reservations are implemented. This detective work requires a lot of local knowledge and contacts, but this knowledge is essential if one wants to figure out what effects reservations actually have and why they were implemented in the first place.

Using new data and an innovative research design, Francesca shows that on average reservations for scheduled castes have no effect on the provision of public goods. Such reservations did, however, reduce turnout and other measures of political participation and electoral competition.

Francesca makes the theoretical and historical argument that reservations were never designed to change the provision of public goods or more generally to increase substantive representation. She traces the historical development of the reservation system to the pre-independence period where it was designed to aid British rule. She argues that the reservation system has been very successful at doing what it was designed to do: guarantee (descriptive) political representation for marginalized groups.

We are writing to nominate both Eleonora Mattiaci and Benjamin Jones for funding to attend and present their work at the Annual Political Methodology Conference.  By screening our students first, we have narrowed our list to these two. Both plan to be on the job market this fall. Both have served as consultants and fellows for the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) at Ohio State and as the TA for the graduate methods sequence.

To cut to the chase: these two are the strongest methods students to come from OSU in a very long time. We believe both will make a strong impression and benefit greatly from attendance, so we sincerely hope both students can present at the meeting. We should emphasize that the order in which we discuss them is arbitrary.

It is a pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Eleonora Mattiacci since she is one of the best social science methodology students we have seen in our collective experience. Eleonora is at the very top in terms of creativity, intelligence and hard work. 

Eleonora entered our program as one of our strongest students and in one of our strongest subfields, International Relations. Eleonora has since then developed considerable expertise in the area of methodology. As a reader of her papers and a member of her dissertation committee (Bear is the chair), we have been very pleased with Eleonora’s success in our graduate program. She has great potential for making innovative contributions to the International Relations field and bringing methodological innovation to the area. An ability to train top graduate students in both International Relations and methodology is a hallmark of our department. 

Box-Steffensmeier has known and worked closely with Eleonora through her role as a fellow in the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) and as a member of her dissertation committee.  Box-Steffensmeier is the director of the PRISM Program, which offers presentations on methods topics, software, and faculty and graduate student methodology consultation. Eleonora excels in these roles. She could expertly explain the simplest technique to a wayward grad student as well as answer some of the faculty=s most complicated questions. It is a demanding role where you need to be very good with many different skills given the diversity of methodological and programming questions you get as a PRISM Fellow. Through such contact, we have discovered that her work is marked by an exceptional combination of virtues, chief among which are exceptional clarity, innovative ideas, and methodological advances. 

Braumoeller, who has taught political science at the University of Illinois, Harvard University, and at Ohio State continuously since 1998, has had the pleasure of working with some outstanding advisees, including Sarah Croco, now a junior professor amassing a remarkable publication and teaching record at the University of Maryland, and Maria Popova, now doing the same at McGill. Eleonora is very much of the same caliber.  She is clearly one of the top 2 or 3 graduate students he has worked with since he started teaching.

Eleonora has identified an important and compelling dissertation project on the subject of volatility in enduring rivalries. One characteristic of this topic that differentiates it significantly from most others is its broad appeal. Surprisingly few scholars take the time to explicate their work in terms that speak to a larger audience, but those who do tend to do well: Robert Putnam would have done far less well with a book called Declining Social Capital in America than he did with Bowling Alone. Eleonora has captured a similarly intuitive insight—the fact that the rivalries between some pairs of states flare up and die down far more abruptly than others—that has the potential to capture the popular imagination if she can explain the origins of these volatile rivalries and show that they are responsible for more than their share of human misery.

This outcome seems extremely likely to us. Rivalries that experience rapid swings from conflict to cooperation will almost certainly prove to be qualitatively different than those that do not, even if the mean levels of conflict are the same. The instability of the former’s relations could produce or reflect domestic instability, uncertainty, or a greater frequency of conflict, for example. These are entirely novel insights: to our knowledge no one has written anything of the sort.

Eleonora’s explanation of volatility in rivalries bridges two levels of analysis within political science, a rare and fruitful avenue of exploration. She points to the degree of ideational similarity and level of fractionalization as the critical variables determining the regularity of interactions at the domestic level: countries with small, homogeneous winning coalitions should produce less conflict and instability and hence less volatility than countries with large, heterogeneous winning coalitions.  She also suggests that the state’s overall role within the global network of international organizations will be the critical variable at the international level: highly active states with a complex array of memberships should exhibit more volatile behavior due to the increased (and variable) influence of other states on their foreign policy behavior.

We are strongly impressed with her command of the literature and alternative ways of researching and testing her ideas. In examining the importance of volatility in the study of conflict, she uses multiple methods and data with varied, rich contextual information to test alternative theoretical explanations. She is leveraging a new data set she has collected to provide unique insight into generalizations that can be made about the volatility of interstate conflict and cooperation. All of this will be a unique contribution to the literature. She has extended existing data sets and assembled and organized some new data in the process of executing her dissertation. This data sets up a broader, longer term research agenda for Eleonora beyond her dissertation too. Attending and presenting at this year’s Political Methodology Meetings is perfect timing for her where feedback can have a critical impact on her work.  

In the area of methodology, Eleonora has considerable expertise in event history, time series, panel data, multilevel modeling and discrete choice analysis. Her work demonstrates sophisticated methods that are closely linked to the substantive questions that drive her research.  She is extending analytic methods that have not yet received much use in political science, such as Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autoregressive conditional Heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) Models. Her employment of those methods will allow her to take into account not only the mean, but the variance of the time series data. Eleonora also brings breadth as a methodologist due to her use of a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods. Indeed, she straddles quantitative and qualitative methods better than most in the field. Bridging such dialogues is important.   

Eleonora’s main strengths, however, beyond her formidable intellect and considerable training, are her passion for what she does and her openness to new ideas.  She is without a doubt the single most enthusiastic graduate student we have ever known.  She seeks out and takes advantage of valuable opportunities that many other graduate students are not even aware of, from conferences to workshops to institutes that provide additional training. As a result, Eleonora’s vita already includes many presentations and a significant degree of recognition. She is an active participant and engaging colleague. She has built a strong reputation for herself by her stellar performance as a discussant. She is thoughtful in her comments and a wonderful contributor to public goods. It is hard to describe in cold prose the sense of excitement and depth of thought that Eleonora brings to her research and teaching. 

In sum, her dissertation is a thoughtful and creative project. Her combination of interests and skills in the areas of International Relations and methodology is unique and valuable.  We have worked together long enough that we have observed that she has the skills, talent, and work ethic that are necessary to plan and execute a successful career. It is time she attends the Political Methodology Meetings. We guarantee she will be an active and memorable participant. She makes and impression and raises the quality of discussion as a participant. If you have any questions we can answer do not hesitate to contact us.

It is equally delightful to write in support of Ben Jones. Ben has been singleminded in his pursuit of both substantive and methodological knowledge while at Ohio State. That work ethic, along with his considerable intelligence, has made him one of the most outstanding graduate students we have had the pleasure of working with.

Ben’s substantive area is civil wars, which in and of itself is noteworthy: despite having one of the strongest and most diverse International Relations faculties in the country, Ohio State currently has no one who specializes exclusively in civil war. Ben’s long hours of research into his main area has made him one of the most formidable graduate students writing on the subject today and places him in the company of top scholars around the country.

Moreover, Ben’s work reflects a degree of old-school thinking and conscientious research that is uncommon in today’s students. To explain the recurrence of civil wars, Ben reaches back to a concept from decades past, one that informed the Peace Studies movement but has rarely been mentioned in mainstream International Relations: Johan Galtung’s idea of “positive peace.” More than just the absence of war (a.k.a. “negative peace”), positive peace is a situation characterized by support for nonviolent norms of conflict resolution, social equality and justice, and a rule of law that provides the means for nonviolent conflict resolution. 

Ben’s contention is that recently-terminated civil wars are pregnant with negative peace, and that the states involved are far more likely to avoid recurrence if they can transition quickly to positive peace. He focuses on the inclusion of a key theoretical idea – that previous interactions shape the bargaining environment in which combatants interact. His combination of a thoroughly modern understanding of agent-environment interactions with the classical concept of negative peace, to our minds, represents a degree of serious scholarship that commands respect.

Ben’s theoretical argument leads to exploration of path dependence and complex sequencing. This topic is of interest in the civil war context, but to methodologists more generally. Methodologically, this leads to an extension of Cox proportional hazards event history model. He develops a multi-state event history model, which allows for an evolutionary process over time. Transitions back and forth are allowed with restrictions on which paths are available at different states of the process. His works emphasizes the entire conflict process and thus leads to more accurate inferences. Ben brings strong programming skills to his work and is a huge plus and almost a requirement for young methodologists today.  

In sum, we have worked with Eleonora and Ben long enough that we have observed that they have the skills, talent, and work ethic that are necessary to plan and execute a successful career. It is time they attend the Political Methodology Meetings both as participants and contributors by presenting their dissertation work. We guarantee they will be active and memorable participants. They both make and impression and raise the quality of discussion as a participant. We are fortunate to have two such high quality students and sincerely hope that there will be room for both of them to attend and present their work. If you have any questions we can answer do not hesitate to contact us.

Dear Methods Conference Selection Committee:

This is a letter of recommendation for Soren Jordan to attend the 2012 Summer Methods Meeting. I have known Soren for about two years as a student in our graduate program, as well as my graduate assistant and coauthor.

In my view, Soren is by far the best methods student ever to come through our program. He has advanced programming skills in R, and works with other software including STATA, LIMDEP, RATS, and PERL. Here at A&M he has taken and excelled in methods courses, including beginning and advanced statistics, maximum likelihood, time series, hierarchical linear models, as well as game theory and experimentation. Utilizing his methods skills, we have coauthored two papers, both of which hold the potential for publication in a major outlet. Unlike many students I’ve coauthored with, Soren is a genuine coauthor and contributor.

Soren would benefit greatly by attending the Summer Methods Meeting and would contribute through interaction with other students and faculty. 

I encourage you to invite him as a funded participant.

Sincerely,

We have worked together in a massive project to forecast human mortality in the US by county, age, sex, and cause, and to search out the political and electoral consequences of these long-term changes.

He will also teach our math prefresher, and organizes our Applied Statistics workshop. Konstantin’s proposal to the conference is to use insights from the causal inference literature to improve methods of automated text analysis.

I have agreed to guarantee funding (at least the registration) for all three, as well as write their letters of recommendation.  Let me say at the outset that all four are technically sophisticated students who are serious about political methodology.  I hope you can admit all four.  That said, I know you will need to prioritize for funding and admittance.  Here is my prioritization of these students.

1.  Brenton Kenkel -- Brenton has been attending the methods conference for a couple of years now.  In 2010, he co-presented a paper with Kevin Clarke and Miguel Rueda.  Last year, he co-presented a paper with me on ""Data Mining for Theorists.""  Last year, Brenton also won the graduate student poster prize at the methods conference for his paper on ""Bounds for Logistic Regression Coefficients with Nonignorable Missing Outcomes.""  We have submitted a paper to present for this conference.  A few years back, Brenton ported my Gauss code and wrote the ""games"" package for R.  He has also done most of the programming for our (not yet distributed) package ""polywog.""  He is a current star lab fellow.  Brenton will be on the job market next year.

2.  Jonathan Olmsted -- Jonathan is a former star lab fellow.  Has passed our more extensive comprehensive exam in methods.  Jonathan's dissertation research focuses on ideal point estimation. His proposed poster, ""Missing the Point,"" concerns the effect of missing data (here roll calls) when the President is included in ideal point estimation.  Jonathan provides two solutions:  one a fairly complicated Bayesian MCMC method using spike/slab priors and the other a simpler two-step method using existing software, which he finds produces similar results.  Jonathan will be on the job market next year.

3.  Jeff Arnold -- Jeff is one of our top methodology students.  He has passed our more extensive comprehensive exam in methods.  Jeff's dissertation consists of applying or developing sophisticated methods to issues in international relations.  His proposal for this methods meeting, ""Pricing the Costly Lottery: Financial Market Reactions to Battlefield Events in the American Civil War,"" is a really interesting paper that uses the prices of Confederate and Union currencies as a measure of expected duration and outcome in the US Civil War.  Jeff has collected new data for this and he employs a sophisticated Bayesian dynamic factor model.  Jeff will be on the job market next year.

4.  Jeff Marshall -- Jeff is an up-and-coming methodologist, junior to the above three.  He has received A's in all of his methods courses.  I have been very impressed with his work to date.  His proposed paper combines spatial econometrics with estimating games for a truly ""geostrategic"" estimator.  It is something I had on my to-do list, but he beat me to it!  Jeff is a really smart and creative young scholar.  He and others would benefit from his attendance.  The only reason I am prioritizing him last is because he is junior to the others. In all other regards, he is just as good.","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor","University of Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-317","received","4935","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor","University of Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-3176","approved","2863","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-06-08","2012-06-08","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","Vegetarian","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","198","","","448.00","mc_gross = 448.00

As her professor in a multiple courses in Washington University’s Political Science Ph.D. program, a co-author, and her dissertation advisor I feel confident in my ability to evaluate her performance and potential.  

Here dissertation research utilizes a number of different methodological approaches using panel data.  Her specific proposal for the Methods meeting is for a paper using Bayesian Hierarchical analysis of political survival.  Although I am not a methodologist, I can say that this paper has numerous applications in political science and can be utilized as a core part of her dissertation project.

Chia-yi is a fantastic student and she would make a major contribution to the methods meeting.

Ph.D. student at Yale for presenting a poster at the summer political
methodology conference.  Although Malte is a Ph.D. student in the
political science department at Yale, I have gotten to know him well
through our collaborative project on causal mediation analysis.  Malte
is technically quite sophisticated, having completed the full
Ph.D. econometrics sequence at Yale: as you may know, the Yale's
econometrics sequence is known as the most mathematically rigorous one
in the country.  In part because Yale Political Science department
does not have a methodologist, Malte approached me at the last year's
polmeth conference and asked me to work with him on a collaborative
project.  Since then, he and I have been studying the nonparametric
identification of causal mediation effects under a set of assumptions
that are weaker than what is currently available in the literature.
His knowledge of nonparametric structural equation models comes at
handy for this project because the identification of causal mechanisms
is essentially a structural equation modeling problem.  I have learned
a lot from Malte already about various nonparametric identification
strategies in the structural equation modeling settings.  In sum,
Malte is a student who should definitely be invited to the conference.
He is a promising future methodologist (remember that there aren't
many of these students) who has received great technical training at a
top institution.  Malte would greatly benefit from attending the
conference so that he can interact with many methodologists: again,
this is beneificial for him because there is no political
methodologist at Yale.  I strongly recommend that Malte be invited to
give a poster on his research project.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@Princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","2215","Huber","Gregory","Prof","Yale","dgs.polisci@yale.edu","2034325731","approved","9991","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-06-03","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

I have agreed to guarantee funding (at least the registration) for all three, as well as write their letters of recommendation.  Let me say at the outset that all four are technically sophisticated students who are serious about political methodology.  I hope you can admit all four.  That said, I know you will need to prioritize for funding and admittance.  Here is my prioritization of these students.

1.  Brenton Kenkel -- Brenton has been attending the methods conference for a couple of years now.  In 2010, he co-presented a paper with Kevin Clarke and Miguel Rueda.  Last year, he co-presented a paper with me on ""Data Mining for Theorists.""  Last year, Brenton also won the graduate student poster prize at the methods conference for his paper on ""Bounds for Logistic Regression Coefficients with Nonignorable Missing Outcomes.""  We have submitted a paper to present for this conference.  A few years back, Brenton ported my Gauss code and wrote the ""games"" package for R.  He has also done most of the programming for our (not yet distributed) package ""polywog.""  He is a current star lab fellow.  Brenton will be on the job market next year.

2.  Jonathan Olmsted -- Jonathan is a former star lab fellow.  Has passed our more extensive comprehensive exam in methods.  Jonathan's dissertation research focuses on ideal point estimation. His proposed poster, ""Missing the Point,"" concerns the effect of missing data (here roll calls) when the President is included in ideal point estimation.  Jonathan provides two solutions:  one a fairly complicated Bayesian MCMC method using spike/slab priors and the other a simpler two-step method using existing software, which he finds produces similar results.  Jonathan will be on the job market next year.

3.  Jeff Arnold -- Jeff is one of our top methodology students.  He has passed our more extensive comprehensive exam in methods.  Jeff's dissertation consists of applying or developing sophisticated methods to issues in international relations.  His proposal for this methods meeting, ""Pricing the Costly Lottery: Financial Market Reactions to Battlefield Events in the American Civil War,"" is a really interesting paper that uses the prices of Confederate and Union currencies as a measure of expected duration and outcome in the US Civil War.  Jeff has collected new data for this and he employs a sophisticated Bayesian dynamic factor model.  Jeff will be on the job market next year.

4.  Jeff Marshall -- Jeff is an up-and-coming methodologist, junior to the above three.  He has received A's in all of his methods courses.  I have been very impressed with his work to date.  His proposed paper combines spatial econometrics with estimating games for a truly ""geostrategic"" estimator.  It is something I had on my to-do list, but he beat me to it!  Jeff is a really smart and creative young scholar.  He and others would benefit from his attendance.  The only reason I am prioritizing him last is because he is junior to the others. In all other regards, he is just as good.","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor","University of Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-317","received","2189","Signorino","Curtis","Associate Professor","University of Rochester","curtis.signorino@rochester.edu","585-414-3176","approved","9098","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-05-18","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","ML","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

We are writing to nominate both Eleonora Mattiaci and Benjamin Jones for funding to attend and present their work at the Annual Political Methodology Conference.  By screening our students first, we have narrowed our list to these two. Both plan to be on the job market this fall. Both have served as consultants and fellows for the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) at Ohio State and as the TA for the graduate methods sequence.

To cut to the chase: these two are the strongest methods students to come from OSU in a very long time. We believe both will make a strong impression and benefit greatly from attendance, so we sincerely hope both students can present at the meeting. We should emphasize that the order in which we discuss them is arbitrary.

It is a pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Eleonora Mattiacci since she is one of the best social science methodology students we have seen in our collective experience. Eleonora is at the very top in terms of creativity, intelligence and hard work. 

Eleonora entered our program as one of our strongest students and in one of our strongest subfields, International Relations. Eleonora has since then developed considerable expertise in the area of methodology. As a reader of her papers and a member of her dissertation committee (Bear is the chair), we have been very pleased with Eleonora’s success in our graduate program. She has great potential for making innovative contributions to the International Relations field and bringing methodological innovation to the area. An ability to train top graduate students in both International Relations and methodology is a hallmark of our department. 

Box-Steffensmeier has known and worked closely with Eleonora through her role as a fellow in the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM) and as a member of her dissertation committee.  Box-Steffensmeier is the director of the PRISM Program, which offers presentations on methods topics, software, and faculty and graduate student methodology consultation. Eleonora excels in these roles. She could expertly explain the simplest technique to a wayward grad student as well as answer some of the faculty=s most complicated questions. It is a demanding role where you need to be very good with many different skills given the diversity of methodological and programming questions you get as a PRISM Fellow. Through such contact, we have discovered that her work is marked by an exceptional combination of virtues, chief among which are exceptional clarity, innovative ideas, and methodological advances. 

Braumoeller, who has taught political science at the University of Illinois, Harvard University, and at Ohio State continuously since 1998, has had the pleasure of working with some outstanding advisees, including Sarah Croco, now a junior professor amassing a remarkable publication and teaching record at the University of Maryland, and Maria Popova, now doing the same at McGill. Eleonora is very much of the same caliber.  She is clearly one of the top 2 or 3 graduate students he has worked with since he started teaching.

Eleonora has identified an important and compelling dissertation project on the subject of volatility in enduring rivalries. One characteristic of this topic that differentiates it significantly from most others is its broad appeal. Surprisingly few scholars take the time to explicate their work in terms that speak to a larger audience, but those who do tend to do well: Robert Putnam would have done far less well with a book called Declining Social Capital in America than he did with Bowling Alone. Eleonora has captured a similarly intuitive insight—the fact that the rivalries between some pairs of states flare up and die down far more abruptly than others—that has the potential to capture the popular imagination if she can explain the origins of these volatile rivalries and show that they are responsible for more than their share of human misery.

This outcome seems extremely likely to us. Rivalries that experience rapid swings from conflict to cooperation will almost certainly prove to be qualitatively different than those that do not, even if the mean levels of conflict are the same. The instability of the former’s relations could produce or reflect domestic instability, uncertainty, or a greater frequency of conflict, for example. These are entirely novel insights: to our knowledge no one has written anything of the sort.

Eleonora’s explanation of volatility in rivalries bridges two levels of analysis within political science, a rare and fruitful avenue of exploration. She points to the degree of ideational similarity and level of fractionalization as the critical variables determining the regularity of interactions at the domestic level: countries with small, homogeneous winning coalitions should produce less conflict and instability and hence less volatility than countries with large, heterogeneous winning coalitions.  She also suggests that the state’s overall role within the global network of international organizations will be the critical variable at the international level: highly active states with a complex array of memberships should exhibit more volatile behavior due to the increased (and variable) influence of other states on their foreign policy behavior.

We are strongly impressed with her command of the literature and alternative ways of researching and testing her ideas. In examining the importance of volatility in the study of conflict, she uses multiple methods and data with varied, rich contextual information to test alternative theoretical explanations. She is leveraging a new data set she has collected to provide unique insight into generalizations that can be made about the volatility of interstate conflict and cooperation. All of this will be a unique contribution to the literature. She has extended existing data sets and assembled and organized some new data in the process of executing her dissertation. This data sets up a broader, longer term research agenda for Eleonora beyond her dissertation too. Attending and presenting at this year’s Political Methodology Meetings is perfect timing for her where feedback can have a critical impact on her work.  

In the area of methodology, Eleonora has considerable expertise in event history, time series, panel data, multilevel modeling and discrete choice analysis. Her work demonstrates sophisticated methods that are closely linked to the substantive questions that drive her research.  She is extending analytic methods that have not yet received much use in political science, such as Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autoregressive conditional Heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) Models. Her employment of those methods will allow her to take into account not only the mean, but the variance of the time series data. Eleonora also brings breadth as a methodologist due to her use of a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods. Indeed, she straddles quantitative and qualitative methods better than most in the field. Bridging such dialogues is important.   

Eleonora’s main strengths, however, beyond her formidable intellect and considerable training, are her passion for what she does and her openness to new ideas.  She is without a doubt the single most enthusiastic graduate student we have ever known.  She seeks out and takes advantage of valuable opportunities that many other graduate students are not even aware of, from conferences to workshops to institutes that provide additional training. As a result, Eleonora’s vita already includes many presentations and a significant degree of recognition. She is an active participant and engaging colleague. She has built a strong reputation for herself by her stellar performance as a discussant. She is thoughtful in her comments and a wonderful contributor to public goods. It is hard to describe in cold prose the sense of excitement and depth of thought that Eleonora brings to her research and teaching. 

In sum, her dissertation is a thoughtful and creative project. Her combination of interests and skills in the areas of International Relations and methodology is unique and valuable.  We have worked together long enough that we have observed that she has the skills, talent, and work ethic that are necessary to plan and execute a successful career. It is time she attends the Political Methodology Meetings. We guarantee she will be an active and memorable participant. She makes and impression and raises the quality of discussion as a participant. If you have any questions we can answer do not hesitate to contact us.

It is equally delightful to write in support of Ben Jones. Ben has been singleminded in his pursuit of both substantive and methodological knowledge while at Ohio State. That work ethic, along with his considerable intelligence, has made him one of the most outstanding graduate students we have had the pleasure of working with.

Ben’s substantive area is civil wars, which in and of itself is noteworthy: despite having one of the strongest and most diverse International Relations faculties in the country, Ohio State currently has no one who specializes exclusively in civil war. Ben’s long hours of research into his main area has made him one of the most formidable graduate students writing on the subject today and places him in the company of top scholars around the country.

Moreover, Ben’s work reflects a degree of old-school thinking and conscientious research that is uncommon in today’s students. To explain the recurrence of civil wars, Ben reaches back to a concept from decades past, one that informed the Peace Studies movement but has rarely been mentioned in mainstream International Relations: Johan Galtung’s idea of “positive peace.” More than just the absence of war (a.k.a. “negative peace”), positive peace is a situation characterized by support for nonviolent norms of conflict resolution, social equality and justice, and a rule of law that provides the means for nonviolent conflict resolution. 

Ben’s contention is that recently-terminated civil wars are pregnant with negative peace, and that the states involved are far more likely to avoid recurrence if they can transition quickly to positive peace. He focuses on the inclusion of a key theoretical idea – that previous interactions shape the bargaining environment in which combatants interact. His combination of a thoroughly modern understanding of agent-environment interactions with the classical concept of negative peace, to our minds, represents a degree of serious scholarship that commands respect.

Ben’s theoretical argument leads to exploration of path dependence and complex sequencing. This topic is of interest in the civil war context, but to methodologists more generally. Methodologically, this leads to an extension of Cox proportional hazards event history model. He develops a multi-state event history model, which allows for an evolutionary process over time. Transitions back and forth are allowed with restrictions on which paths are available at different states of the process. His works emphasizes the entire conflict process and thus leads to more accurate inferences. Ben brings strong programming skills to his work and is a huge plus and almost a requirement for young methodologists today.  

In sum, we have worked with Eleonora and Ben long enough that we have observed that they have the skills, talent, and work ethic that are necessary to plan and execute a successful career. It is time they attend the Political Methodology Meetings both as participants and contributors by presenting their dissertation work. We guarantee they will be active and memorable participants. They both make and impression and raise the quality of discussion as a participant. We are fortunate to have two such high quality students and sincerely hope that there will be room for both of them to attend and present their work. If you have any questions we can answer do not hesitate to contact us.

I have known Azadeh since 2009 when she joined the Complex Systems track of the Ph.D in Informatics program at Indiana University. Since then, I have co-supervised her research and academic progress together with Professor Jean Camp. During my sabbatical in the academic year of 2009-2010 she was part of my research team at the FLAD Computational Biology Collaboratorium of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, a leading Life Sciences research center in Portugal (recently considered a Top 10 research institution outside of the USA by The Scientist) .

Azadeh has worked with me in various Literature Mining projects in the biomedical domain, but her research has focused on developing further a bio-inspired classifier my group has previously produced for spam and text classification. This is an adaptive classifier based on a model of T-Cell cross-regulation in the vertebrate adaptive immune system.  A nice feature of this classifier is that it depends on the sequence and timing of items encountered, which makes it a good candidate to deal with concept drift in textual data streams. Azadeh’s goal is to study concept drift in political discourse, as gathered from repositories of parliamentary speeches (in Hong Kong, the U.S., and the France), as well as, eventually Twitter feeds. 

Towards this goal she has formed a very exciting collaboration with Norbert Chen, a fellow Ph.D. student in political science at Indiana University. They intend to present the preliminary results of this collaboration	at PolMeth, especially on the topic of concept drift detection in political discourse. This research is very worthy of support, since it brings a fresh computational social science, complex systems perspective, grounded in political science methodology. Azadeh and Norbert would profit tremendously from participating in PolMeth. They would be able to showcase their initial results and receive most important feedback from domain experts. Personally, Azadeh is a very friendly and socially connected individual. She easily traverses many cultures, and is very dear to everyone in the program. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any additional questions.","Rocha","Luis","Associate Professor","Indiana Unibversity","rocha@indiana.edu","8128561832","received","6452","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-05-29","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","WS","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

Rich is at the top of his strong cohort. He took my class concurrently with a methods class that normally follows it, and he has subsequently taken a long list of classes in the statistics department.

I especially like the paper Rich wrote in my class on causal inference, using matching for time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. The question answered in this paper has been posed repeatedly by researchers for many years in a variety of disciplines and so I suspect the paper will be widely read. Previously, scholars had thought that TSCS matching was basically hopeless, not because of the methods but because of the data. Rich correctly reinterprets the problem and shows that the only real difference between matching in TSCS and standard cross-sectional data is that the the covariates are much richer in the former, as they include the entire past history of each unit. So matching applications without many covariates seem easy to apply
but this hides what may be a problem with omitted variable bias. This insight then leads to an approach to TSCS matching that directly generalizes existing methods
in a useful way.

Rich and I have worked closely together on several matching-related research projects. We’ve already written two papers together, and I suspect we will write others. I have seen him work very hard on difficult problems and routinely unearth solutions others had not thought of. He can do all the math that’s needed in whatever problem we study, but his specialty is innovative high level conceptual thinking about methodological topics that is disarmingly simple and very powerful. My work is made better by our collaborations.

Rich’s innovative dissertation work is on the spread of Jihadi ideology, using methods of automated text analysis methods for Arabic language documents. He has single-handedly collected a an enormous digital collection of Fatwa’s (Islamic rulings), numbering more than 200,000 documents. In contrast, prior analyses have focused on only a dozen or two. As reading a much larger number is impossible, the future of this field will certainly involve a great deal of automated text analysis methods. When the field eventually becomes conversant with these methods, and numerous articles and books get written using them, they will look back on Rich’s work as the spark which began it all. He’s also tackled his substantive questions from other
angles, such as collecting web data click through data, and he has other innovative sources of data in the works as well.

Rich is sure to make it at the very top of this profession. He has my strong support and I encourage you to give him the same.

I am pleased to write this letter in support of Mark Nieman’s application for the 2012 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Nieman in three of my methods classes and can say that he is currently one our best graduate students in methods. Nieman is in his fourth year in the program and has taken three courses from me, attended the methods conference last summer, and took Curt Signorino’s EITM-style course at the Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis last summer. 

Last year, Nieman’s presented a paper that applied Bayesian change point analysis as developed by Chib (and used recently in political science by Jong Hee Park) to test constructivist and rationalist theories of international relations. I found this particularly impressive since he had to learn the method and its implementation on his own. This year he plans to present work from a new project applying strategic probit analysis to the study of civil war. The innovation here involves a data problem Nieman encountered while working on his dissertation. While conflict data generally differentiate between cases in which revisionists claims are made and acceded to by the target and cases in which no claim is made, such information does not exist for civil wars. This makes it impossible to directly estimate a strategic probit model. Nieman will modify the strategic probit model to account for this lack of information in the data. This will involve modifying the likelihood and programming the new estimator, which should still be able to recover the underlying parameter values even when the data do not indicate whether a lack of conflict results from the absence of a demand or capitulation if one was made.

I believe that Nieman’s research would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. He has progressed quite well since attending last year and is developing a dissertation project that will utilize and extend the new tools he has learned in the past couple of years and has begun the process of moving from a consumer of advanced methods to a producer of new methods. Since he will be on the job market this fall, this would be a particularly fortuitous time for him to attend the meeting.

Please let me know if you any questions.

Jen Pan is an exceptional student —highly focused, innovative, and hard working—likely to be a star in our field. I got to know her when she took my class in advanced statistical methodology. From a class of about 75, I selected her to teach our math prefresher class to the incoming students. This is an important distinction, but all the more so coming from a more traditionally qualitative field of Chinese studies. Her paper in my class, in her first year in graduate school, is currently under revision at a major journal; I expect it to be accepted for publication in due course.

Jen and I are now working together with another student on a project on Chinese and American public opinion expressed in social media posts. We have a feed of all Chinese and English social media posts, harvested from the web in real time and including many that are subsequently taken down by the Chinese government. We’re adapting methods of automated text analysis to compare expressed opinion in these two countries. Its a privilege to be working with a student who is so professional, engaged, and knowledgeable.

Jen also has valuable experience in public health from her current work, and even in the business world from her past. I strongly support her and her work and encourage you to do the same. I am quite sure that you will not be disappointed.

Sincerely,
~~

I know Anna quite well;  she was in two of my graduate courses, worked as my RA for 2 ½ years, and I am her dissertation chair.  She is an excellent student studying international politics and methods, focusing on combining the use of agent-based and statistical methods to study international conflict resolution.  She has done exceptionally well in both substantive and methods courses.

In her dissertation, Anna is developing a computational (agent-based) model of international conflict and conflict joining in order to study why it is that when states intervene in conflict, the conflict tends to end sooner, but the duration of peace following settlement is also reduced (i.e. new outbreaks of conflict tend to occur sooner).  There are several new theoretical aspects to what Anna is doing.  In dealing with the core substantively important puzzle about intervention, conflict termination, and subsequent peace duration, Anna works from the differences in goals that states have when they intervene militarily, diplomatically, and economically in conflict, examining how the combination of varying goals and different forms of intervention have implications for long vs. short-term conflict settlement.  A simulation model that allows examination of the effects of anticipated multi-actor behaviors and worlds where states hold different goals is promising for understanding how a relatively simple choice to intervene or not actually leads to a much more complicated set of aggregate outcome patterns.

Anna is developing an agent-based model to derive new predictions about intervention and its effects.  Most importantly for purposes of this application, in order to develop hypotheses about the relationship between input parameters and these outputs, Anna is developing automated general procedures using genetic algorithms to explore the parameter space of her simulation (or indeed, any simulation).  The point of using simulation methods is to investigate situations where outcomes may be highly context dependent, and where particular combinations of parameters may yield very different (non-linear) results than we’d expect over the range of those parameters.  In small simulation problems, we would typically do an exhaustive search of the search space (varying all parameters over their range at regular intervals, but generating all combinations of values for all parameters).  As the number of parameters in a simulation grows, this becomes prohibitive in terms of computational time.  It also becomes difficult to even assess the range of results to identify how increases or decreases in parameters affect outcomes (in a comparative statics sense).  The efficiency of genetic algorithms for searching rough parameter landscapes is well known, particularly in comparison to traditional/baseline hill-climbing type techniques.  As Miller (1998) suggested, applying machine learning techniques (a GA) to simulations in general seems a fruitful way to proceed to explore a simulation problem.  I have seen this done relatively few times, though, and Anna has been working to write code for a general program that can do this, calling on any external simulation routine.  Her PolMeth poster would discuss the technique in more detail, and provide an example of the technique and a comparison to the application of a standard hill-climbing technique, and an exhaustive search procedure.  This is an unusual application of a GA, and the development of a general program will run into interesting challenges including the possibility that results may not be unique (e.g. various combinations of parameters may lead to similar outcomes), and that there may be several interesting local optima that we would like to identify and investigate.  

In her dissertation, Anna also intends to work with events data to do statistical analysis of conflict intervention and outcome patterns to see if real-world behavior is consistent with the behavior predicted by the model.  It is possible, although less likely, that she will be able to add some discussion of empirical hypothesis tests.  The focus is likely to remain the application of the GA to the search problem.

Anna has an interesting problem of applying a general technique (genetic algorithms) to a relatively-general methodological area (simulation models).  Her poster will be interesting and well-done.  I give her my strongest recommendation.","Bennett","Scott","Distinguished Professor","Pennsylvania State University","sbennett@psu.edu","814-865-6566","received","9943","","","","","apechenkina@gmail.com","","approved","2226","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-05-23","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","No beef or pork","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","WS","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,0

I’ve known Andrew Pierce for two years as a graduate student, research assistant, and co-author of mine. Andrew has proven himself to be a valuable colleague and collaborator. 

Andrew is already on the cusp of becoming a published author in methodology, as we currently have been invited to revise and resubmit a paper to Political Analysis. In that paper, we present a technique and critical test statistic for assessing the fit of a binary dependent variable model (e.g., a logit or probit). The fit statistics traditionally used in political science, such as the AIC, ROC, and percent correctly predicted, are designed to assess compare models or assess their power to correctly separate the dependent variable into successes and failures. By contrast, our technique allows researchers to detect problems with a model's specification that obscure substantive understanding of the underlying data generating process, such as missing interaction terms or unmodeled non-linearities. We show that these problems go undetected by the fit statistics most commonly used in political science. 

In his independent work, Andrew studies legislative behavior. His latest project attempts to explain the evolution of ideological polarization in the United States in an unexpected way. While most research argues that ideological polarization is linked to income inequality levels or to the occurrence of catastrophic events like the Great Depression, Andrew argues that the entrance of a large number of politically unsophisticated citizens into the voting population—namely, newly enfranchised women at the turn of the 20th Century—caused a temporary reversion from the normally polarized state of politics that prevailed before to an era of greater consensus because (like most politically unsophisticated persons) these women were moderates. As later generations of women were progressively more socialized into the political system, Andrew argues, they became progressively more polarized and the pre-existing equilibrium gradually re-established itself. 

As a student with a strong interest in methodology, I think Andrew would get a great deal out of attending the methods meetings, seeing the cutting edge work being presented there, getting feedback on his projects, and getting to know some of his future colleagues. I hope that you’ll agree that he would benefit from attending the conference and will give him the chance to do so.

Marius Radean is a Ph.D. candidate at Florida State University, and he is applying for funding to attend Polmeth XXIX at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University.  I am the co-chair of his dissertation committee and am writing this letter as his faculty sponsor.  Marius will be on the job market this coming fall and will benefit enormously from attending the Methods Meeting.

The poster he would present is based on part of his dissertation, and addresses the issue of party switching.  As you may know, legislators frequently switch parties between elections in many countries around the world.  Party switching raises important normative concerns about representation and accountability.  To date, the existing literature explains party switching almost exclusively in terms of the factors that lead a legislator to want to change party, and empirical tests typically involve some kind of logit or probit where the dependent variable is 1 if there is a party switch, 0 otherwise.  The problem is that this approach ignores the fact that we only observe party switching when a legislator wants to switch parties and when a party is willing to accept the legislator.  In Marius’ dissertation, he presents a formal model of party switching that recognizes the strategic nature of this two-way interaction.  His model demonstrates that many of the factors commonly thought to influence party switching actually have opposing effects on the potential defecting legislator and potential recipient party.  An implication of this is that the magnitude and statistical significance of the results from a standard logit or probit analysis are likely to be misleading because they are effectively “averaging” the positive and negative effects of the model’s covariates. Significantly, this goes a long way to explaining why the empirical literature on party switching is largely characterized by inconsistent and conflicting findings.  To test the hypotheses from his theoretical model, Marius derives a new “partial observability” model that is specifically designed to deal with the strategic two-way interaction process involved in party switching.

Przeworski and Vreeland (2002) were the first scholars to introduce partial observability models into political science when they applied Abowd and Farber’s (1982) bivariate probit with partial observability to the study of IMF agreements.  As Przeworksi and Vreeland noted, an IMF agreement is only observed when a government asks for help and when the IMF agrees to help.  In effect, the government can ask for help or not (y1), and the IMF can agree to help or not (y2).  If we observe an IMF agreement, then we know that y1 and y2 must both be equal to 1.  But if we do not observe an IMF agreement, then we do not know whether this is because (i) y1 = 1 but y2 = 0, (ii) y1 = 0 but y2 = 1, or (iii) y1 = 0 and y2 = 0.  Instead of observing x, y1, and y2, the analyst can only observe x and z, were z = y1 × y2.  Below is Abowd and Farber’s bivariate probit model with partial observability:

Pr(z = 1) = Φ(x1β1)Φ(x2β2)

Pr(z = 0) = 1 – Φ(x1β1)Φ(x2β2)

where x1 refers to covariates influencing the decision of the national government and x2 refers to covariates influencing the decision of the IMF.  It follows directly from this that the log-likelihood function for this model is:

lnL = Σ{z Φ(x1β1)Φ(x2β2) + (1-z) [1 – Φ(x1β1)Φ(x2β2)]}

The partial observability model derived by Marius is slightly different.  Legislators do not decide whether to switch parties or not.  Instead, they must choose to stick with their home party or switch to one of the other parties in the party system.  In other words, legislators are confronted with a multichotomous, rather than a discrete, choice.  As a result, the legislator’s decision can be modeled using McFadden’s (1974) conditional logit.  In contrast, the decision confronting a potential recipient party remains dichotomous, and can be modeled with a logit (or probit).  Again, we only observe a party switch when the legislator chooses to switch to another party and that party accepts.  Following the intuition behind Abowd and Farber’s bivariate probit with partial observability, Marius combines a conditional logit (for the legislator) with a logit (for the party) to produce what he calls a conditional logit-logit with partial observability.

In his proposed poster for Methods, Marius applies his new partial observability model to an original data set that he collected on the 51st, 52nd, and 53rd legislatures in Brazil (1999-2010).  The unit of observation is the legislator-party dyad.  There were 289 instances of party switching during this time period.  The empirical results firmly support his theoretical predictions.  His analysis also confirms that the results from the types of traditional logit analyses found in the existing literature are misleading since such results effectively capture a weighted average of a covariate’s effect on the legislator’s decision and its possible opposing effect on the party’s decision.

In his dissertation, Marius also applies his empirical model to a second original data set that he collected on party switching in Romania.  The large-N quantitative analyses in his dissertation are then supplemented by more qualitative evidence derived from interviews that he conducted with leading political figures in Romania during his field research.

In sum, I think Marius will benefit a great deal by interacting with other young methodologists at the Methods Meeting.  His work is theoretically grounded, methodologically innovative, and empirically new.  I am happy to recommend his for funding.  If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

A fourth year graduate student at Florida State University, Carlisle stands out as being among the most sophisticated methodologists ever to circulate in our graduate program.  In addition to pursuing a Ph.D. in political science (with field concentrations in American and Comparative), Carlisle is finishing up his M.S. in Mathematical Statistics.  I am envious of the methods tool kit at his disposal.  He has understanding of measure-theoretic probability, likelihood-based inference, generalized linear models, Bayesian inference, MCMC methods, and hierarchical models, among other things.  To convey the confidence that others place in Carlisle’s abilities, he served as the teaching assistant for our advanced quantitative methods course already in the fall of 2010 when John Ahlquist taught it.  In addition, this semester Jason Barabas is going to rely on Carlisle to present the material on hierarchical models in his special topics advanced quantitative class.
	Indicative of the quality of work that Carlisle produces, his solo-authored essay, entitled “Strategic Mobilization: Why Disproportional Districts Increase Partisan Mobilization Efforts,” received a positive revise-and-resubmit from the American Journal of Political Science.  He has returned the product and is currently waiting on its second round decision.  My most direct exposure to Carlisle’s abilities have been his efforts on an essay that examines split population models (including partial-observability models) as a response to over-report of voter turnout in survey data.  The typical roles have been reversed on this project, as I primarily get data ready for Carlisle, who in turn oversees the statistical modeling.  He has several other papers in development, some of which (e.g., “Testing Hypotheses of No Effect in Political Science” and “Comparing Experimental Treatment Effects in Political Science”) have a methods focus, and others (e.g., “Does Magnitude Matter? The Case of Taiwan”) of which rely on sophisticated methods to assess substantive questions.","Jackson","Robert","Professor","Florida State University","rjackson@fsu.edu","850-644-7307","received","4204","Moore","Will H.","Professor","Florida State University","will.moore@fsu.edu","8506446924","approved","5095","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-06-11","2012-06-11","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","Yes","MX","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","148.5","","","398.50","mc_gross = 398.50

I’d like to support Ms. Evangeline Reynolds to attend the 2012 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. Ms. Reynolds is an advanced graduate student in the political science department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She is in excellent standing. I know her well because she has taken two graduate seminars with me. In addition, I have served as her faculty advisor. I am pleased to say that Ms. Reynolds is very smart and hard working. She has a powerfully analytical mind and has excellent potential to contribute to research methodology as applied particularly to the areas of international law and institutions.   

In her dissertation project, Ms. Reynolds seeks to shed light on a number of difficult but important questions in International Relations. How do international pressures, interacting with domestic forces, influence national policies? In particular, how do external pressures influence national policies in different countries to different extent? In particular, how do we capture these effects empirically? 

In the paper she’d like to present at the Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology, Ms. Reynolds problematizes some commonly used methodology in the scholarship of international law and institutions. She scrutinizes a wide range of empirical findings that report significant effects of international law on states behavior. In particular, she uses placebo intervention to highlight the fragility of the commonly used modeling strategies. This paper promises to make a major contribution to empirical methodology in international relations. 

I’d appreciate it if you could give Ms. Evangeline Reynolds’ application the careful consideration it deserves. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Doug is an ambitious, exciting young scholar doing cutting-edge work at the intersection of judicial politics, public policy, and political methodology, and I believe his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we study law and courts. 

I have known Doug since the fall of 2008, when he began working as a research assistant on an NSF-supported project of mine.  He also took several classes (both substantive and methodological) from me.  During 2008-2009, I served as the primary advisor on his M.A. thesis, and I am currently the director of his Ph.D. thesis committee.  Doug has also served as the Political Science department's methods preceptor, a position I oversaw, and he and I are working on several ongoing research projects together. I believe I am well-positioned to evaluate his qualifications for the meeting.

It is important to note at the outset that Doug is not the typical ""law guy.""  In grappling with questions about judicial politics, he is first and foremost a scholar of American political institutions, and approaches his study of the courts from that perspective.   His Ph.D. thesis, ""Agenda Dynamics in the Federal Courts,"" reflects this focus.  It is a comprehensive study of the agenda of the U.S. federal courts at all levels.  In it, he asks and answers some fundamental questions about the federal courts in the United States: What do they do? To which policy areas do they devote more or less attention?  What are the important differences in the courts' policy agendas as one moves up the federal judicial hierarchy?  And, most significantly, how do the courts' agendas mesh with those of other federal institutions?  This is, for the most part, uncharted territory; few contemporary scholars have focused on the courts' agenda, and none have done so in so comprehensive a fashion.

Beyond his Ph.D. thesis, Doug is engaged in a number of other promising research projects, nearly all of which revolve around fundamentally similar questions.  His M.A. thesis, ""The Impact of Supreme Court Activity on the Judicial Agenda: Calling to Action or Settling the Law?"", addresses a central question about the U.S. Supreme Court: do decisions by the Court prompt further litigation, or settle the law and lead to fewer cases on that issue in the future?  While the conventional legal view suggests the latter, a number of influential empirical studies suggest a mobilizing influence for Court decisions.  Drawing on heretofore unexamined data, Doug's paper resolves this question, showing clear evidence of a ""settling"" effect of the high Court's rulings.  The paper is a tour de force -- thoughtfully argued, meticulously executed, and rich with implications for students of courts, interest groups, and public policy -- and won several awards, including runner-up in the ICPSR's national, multidisciplinary competition for best graduate student paper.

A common thread running through all this work is Doug's extensive and pathbreaking use of text data and machine learning methods.  For something close to two millennia, the stock in trade of judges and other interpreters of the law has been text: judicial decisions are accompanied by extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- written justifications, concurrences, and dissents.  This fact has meant that to date individuals who were serious about examining case content were required to pour over mountains of written material in order to glean meaning from it. Indeed, it can be argued that the entire contemporary American legal profession exists solely because of the growth and increasing complexity of the language of the common law.

In his time at Penn State, Doug has leveraged the department's and university's resources and expertise in machine learning and textual data analysis to develop both the skill set and the theoretical background to revolutionize the way we study judicial politics. Doug's 2011 Midwest Political Science Association paper, ""Measuring Salience: An Automated Text Analysis of Media Coverage of Supreme Court Decisions,"" provides an example of these skills.  There, he draws upon recent advances in semi-supervised machine learning (in particular, named entity recognition) to develop a measure of the salience of Supreme Court decisions that offers a number of significant advantages over the most widely used such measure (developed by Lee Epstein and Jeff Segal more than a decade ago).  His revised measure will, I believe, become the gold standard for how we assess the political importance of the high Court's decisions.  More important, however, is that it demonstrates the practical applicability of machine learning methods to the study of law and courts.

In the short term, these skills have enabled Doug to build a set of measures of the federal courts' agenda over the past 40+ years, measures that are central to his Ph.D. thesis.  Over the longer term, however, the potential applications for such approaches in the study of courts and judges are almost limitless.  Consider, for example, the study of judicial decision making.  To date (and currently), scholars of judicial decisions have focused on votes.  We do so not because votes are especially important -- their aggregate tallies only determine who wins and loses the instant case -- but rather because they are an easily observable and measurable indicator of behavior with a modicum of validity and reliability.  An important critique of this approach, however, is that it is the language of the opinion, rather than the decision of who wins and who loses, that is the significant part of a judge's or court's determination.  By systematically extracting and analyzing information from the text of court opinions, such approaches -- when combined with a strong theoretical perspective -- have the potential to revolutionize the way we study judges' decisions.

Doug's development of these skills has not gone unnoticed.  Already Doug has forged a working relationship with Professors Jeff Lax (Columbia University) and Tom Clark (Emory University) to use machine learning approaches in the service of the study of judicial politics, and his paper with Skyler Cranmer (UNC - Chapel Hill) and Randy Siverson (UC - Davis) on improving the specification of lags in time series analysis is currently under review.  Moreover, Doug also has strong skills in more conventional quantitative methods: he has both taken and been a teaching assistant for courses on maximum likelihood / generalized linear models, time series analysis, and multilevel models, and utilizes the last of these extensively in his award-winning M.A. paper.

In summary, I offer my strong support for Doug's application to attend the 2012 POLMETH meeting.  He offers a truly unique combination of theoretical depth and methodological skills, one which will position him to be among the leading lights of the next generation of scholars in judicial politics and political methodology.  Thank you for your consideration; if there is any further information you require, or if I can be of any additional assistance, please let me know.

Roberts

Quick summary: Molly Roberts is enthusiastic and really smart, and I’d definitely support her. She came to graduate school well trained in methods and statistics, and political science in 

general, including an MA from Stanford. She seems to survive on an ever increasing diet of new ideas, new methods, new research, and a whole lot of work. From a class of about 75, I chose her to 

be one of two teaching fellows for the next year. She was so good at being a teaching fellow that I asked her to do it again and she is doing a terrific job. The students love her.

In addition to an excellent technical background, she has deep substantive interests. These include comparative politics, including banking and development policies in East Asia, international 

political economy, including the politics of non-tariff trade barriers and WTO dispute resolution, and American politics, such as Congressional determinants of trade policy and globalization 

attitudes in the mass public.

Molly and I are now working together with another student on a project on Chinese and American public opinion expressed in millions of social media posts. We have a feed of all Chinese and 

English social media posts, harvested from the web in real time and including many that are subsequently taken down by the Chinese government. We’ve adapted methods of automated text analysis to 

compare expressed opinion in these two countries. Molly knows Chinese well enough to code text herself and direct a team of Chinese coders, knows enough about the issues and interest of the 

Chinese government to carefully parse Chinese government statements and to select issue for us to track, and understands the technical background enough to make serious methodological 

contributions too. This work has also blossomed into a large scale study of censorship in China, including analyses of the text censored social media posts, which we have found a way to obtain 

before the Chinese government manages to take them down.

Here are two illustrations of how committed Molly is to research. First, when she arrived here, she came by and expressed her interest in working as a research assistant with me. As I always do 

in cases like these, I sent her back to her classes (funding isn’t an issue for admitted students and the time devoted to classes seems valuable for at least the first couple of years). She did 

as I suggested but then came back a few weeks later, and then again, and again, pushing hard to be involved in research. She just had more bandwidth than others, and we’ve been working closely 

together every since. Someone who constantly challenges herself is exactly the right profile for someone who will make it a long way.

Second, and just as telling: I had two projects I decided she might like to be involved in and offered her the choice. One was a big, exciting, visible project with big public policy 

implications and for which there would likely be a lot of media interest. The other involved a highly technical statistical programming project involving aspects of ecological inference. I bet 

19 of 20 graduate students would choose the first. Molly chose the more difficult path, and we will have our first paper on ecological inference together shortly.

We don’t often get students like this, but I wish we did; I strongly encourage you to support her. She deserves it and you’ll be as thrilled as I am to work with her. Please contact me if I can 

provide more details.

Sincerely,
~~

To Whom It May Concern:

I am pleased to write in support of Michael Sances’s application to attend the 2012 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. I think that attending the conference this summer would help his career development greatly. Mike attended the conference last year and got a lot out of the experience. He got some great feedback on his thesis project (which then was in its early stages) and met some great people. I think he would be well served by attending again. He is well deserving of a spot on the program.

I have known Mike for almost four years in both a classroom setting and as a research assistant. Mike is a dedicated and skillful researcher and has received excellent technical training. I am confident that he will be successful in graduate school and beyond. 

Mike is part of a new cohort of graduate students at MIT who study political behavior – something new for us. Though he can be a little quiet and reserved, I think that he may have the most promise among the students I have had a chance to interact with. 

Mike has taken all the methods courses we offer in the department and has also taken courses in the economics department at MIT (no small feat given the rigor of that program). He has done extremely well and, as a result, his training is suburb. I sat on his methods preliminary exam last year and he performed at a higher level on that exam than any other graduate student I have seen in my 13 years on faculty at Princeton and MIT (including my former student and colleague Gabe Lenz). 

In my Public Opinion Research Training Lab class, Mike was a leader in designing the survey we fielded a couple years ago. He always brought interesting insights to bear on the topics we discussed and he did a great job of critiquing the items proposed by other students (always in a positive and constructive manner).

In 2009, Mike served as a research assistant on a project that strives to put together a comprehensive archive of public opinion data from the mid-1930s through the mid-1940s. This project involves approximately 450 polls conducted during this period.  Eric Schickler (UC-Berkeley and I received funding from the National Science Foundation to complete the project and Mike performed a variety of tasks, including designing a web interface and completing some difficult recoding tasks. He did a superb job.

For the last year Mike has served as an RA in my new Political Experiments Research Lab (PERL). His tasks ranged from setting up and programming new packages to complicated experimental design. I rely heavily on Mike’s expertise and I know that I could not survive without his help.  

I should also note that Mike turned a paper on political participation that he wrote in his second year of graduate school into an excellent article at Political Behavior. Mike has also received funding from the Time Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences project to conduct original experiments on campaign finance. These projects are unrelated to his dissertation, and show that he can effectively complete many first-rate projects at once.

Mike’s proposed poster (which draws from his dissertation) on the effects of direct elections of property tax assessors is extremely interesting. Mike is still collecting data, but what he has so far suggests that direct democracy can change the outcomes of government in important ways. I am sure that Mike will produce a poster of quality comparable to the best posters I have seen at the methods conference over the years.

In sum, I have no doubt that Mike deserves a place at the methods conference this summer. If you have any other questions about Mike, please feel free to contact me directly at (617) 253-8190.

Sincerely,

I highly recommend Victoria Shineman’s application for a poster presentation at the methods meeting.  Victoria is one of our top students in the political science PhD program at New York University.  In her research Victoria investigates the relationship between compulsory voting and information.  Many political scientists have argued about whether voting should be compulsory.  Those opposed worry that compulsory voting will result in the participation of those who are less informed and lead to outcomes that are not necessarily in their interests, while others argue that compulsory voting will induce individuals to become informed because they will be more likely to participate and thus will have a positive impact.  This is a largely open question and often debated across many countries from Australia and Brazil (where compulsory voting is currently used) to Switzerland and Austria (where compulsory voting has been used in the past) to the United States (which has never used compulsory voting) consider how voter turnout decisions impact election outcomes.  

Victoria has tackled her research question using a variety of methods across a number of countries.  Theoretically, she has developed a formal model that shows that compulsory voting will weakly increase informed voting, but not increase uninformed voting.  She has a conducted laboratory experiment in which she finds that indeed her prediction is supported and that compulsory voting does lead to more informed voting.  She has gathered original data from Austria and Switzerland for a unique empirical comparison of regions which discontinuous compulsory voting at different time periods, allowing her to arguably measure the causal effect of compulsory voting holding cultural and election choices constant.  

Victoria recently completed an NSF funded field experiment testing the implications of the theory on the relationship between mobilization and information, which will be the subject of her poster.  The field experiment was conducted during the mayoral election in San Francisco, which used the new method of instant runoff voting.  Victoria used a randomized treatment assignment in which treated subjects were given rewards in terms of payments for participation (legal in California nonfederal elections) and/or information about the upcoming election (which was fairly complicated).  She finds that indeed subsidizing turnout does lead voters to become more informed about the choices before them.  Her design is a large step forward in the growing literature on field experiments and voting in American elections and uses a clever design to use a field experiment to test hypotheses derived from more formalized theory than is typical in this literature.  I expect that her experiment will be publishable in one of the top journals in the discipline.

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
While Yuki is only a second year student, I strongly recommend that he
be allowed to present his work at the poster session.  The reason is
that Yuki is one of the very few ""pure"" methodologist students at
Princeton.  In my advanced graduate methodology course, he was the
best student by a big margin.  The last such student was Teppei
Yamamoto, who had received junior methods position offers from several
schools and is now an assistant professor at MIT.  It is still too
early for me to tell how successful Yuki will be, but he has the same
level of talent in methodology as Teppei and so I wouldn't be
surprised if he becomes one of the most promising young methodologists
in the country in a couple of years.  In my opinion, it is very
important for students like Yuki to attend the political methodology
summer conference so that they are socialized with the members of the
society.  As a second year student, Yuki has been working with me on
several projects this year, which we hope to submit to journals for
publication sometime this summer.  The work he is planning to propose
at the summer methods conference grew out of the seminar paper he
wrote for an advanced graduate methods course.  In that paper, he
shows that once temporal dynamics and cross-sectional heterogeneity
are taken into account, many of the existing empirical results go
away.  In sum, Yuki is one of the very few political methodology
students in the country.  There are many students at Princeton and
elsewhere who can apply advanced methods to substantive problems but
are unable to develop new statistical methods.  Yuki is a student who
will be able to make real methodological contributions to the field in
the near future and it is very important for the society to give
students like Yuki an opportunity to attend the summer methodology
conference.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","1212","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","3799","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-06-11","2012-06-11","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","1","1","1","","","MS","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00

I have had multiple opportunities to interact with Ian and feel that I can give a thorough and honest evaluation of his work and aptitude. Last semester Ian was the top performing student in my Advanced Quantitative Methods course, earning one of only two As in a class of twelve students. His work in that course illustrated that he possessed both a thorough understanding of the material I presented and the motivation to seek out additional resources on his own to expand his knowledge and understanding beyond the scope of the course. This semester, Ian is serving as my research assistant. However, his contribution to the project I assigned him goes far beyond what I expect from a research assistant. He has made significant contributions to the development of the project such that I now consider him to be an equal collaborator rather than simply a research assistant and have added him to the project as a coauthor.

The project that he submitted for a poster session at the 2012 Summer Meeting of the Society of Political Methodology exemplifies the positive traits I have already discussed. He presented an earlier version of this project to complete the poster project requirement of my Advanced Quantitative Methods course. Not only did the project itself show great promise, but his presentation was polished and professional. I am strongly convinced that this project will eventually result in a published article in a peer-reviewed journal both for its contribution to an important theoretical debate in the International Relations literature and for its methodological contribution.

Having the opportunity to present his research at this conference would be especially beneficial for Ian on an additional level as well. The quality of his work is at the level of students at higher ranked programs, as evidenced by his recent invitation to revise and resubmit a solo authored manuscript for {\it Comparative Political Studies}. While we have many exceptional scholars on our faculty here at GSU, our budget at GSU does not allow us to bring in outside speakers as often as many other programs. An opportunity to attend this conference would offer a young scholar with tremendous potential the ability to meet and interact with some of the top scholars in the field of political methodology that he cannot get here at GSU and that is difficult, if not impossible, at larger conferences such as APSA and MPSA.","Fix","Michael","Assistant Professor","Georgia State University","mfix@gsu.edu","404.413.6155","received","4431","Smith","Ian","","Georgia State University","ismith7@gsu.edu","678-378-5256","approved","7901","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-05-25","2012-05-25","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","Yes","ML","","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00

To Whom It May Concern:

I am happy to write in support of Flori So’s proposal.    Flori is an energetic, hard-working and committed scholar.   She is making excellent progress on a important dissertation project that will contribute to our understanding of leadership change in political parties, how it occurs and what consequences it brings. 

Flori’s dissertation begins with cross-national study of the consequences of party leadership change in advanced democracies since WWII.   She compiled an extensive dataset of party leadership changes in advanced democracies, documenting a number of systematic correlates of leadership change, and discovering several provocative ways  that governing status and institutional structure interact with the impact of a new leader.   This analysis is limited in some ways, however, by concerns about endogeneity.  That is, does a party pick a new leader because it is in electoral trouble, or is it the new leader who actually causes vote share to fall?   Flori points out this problem, and proceeds in subsequent chapters to sort out the direction of causality by modelling the decisions to replace an old leader and to select a new one.    Even with the acknowledged endogeneity concern, however, this chapter’s cross national systematic analysis of the correlates of leadership change make a valuable contribution.   This chapter has been well received when Flori has presented it at professional conferences (APSA, SC2PI) and an invited presentation at Södertörn University this past fall.

To develop her model of the leadership replacement process, Flori systematically read journalistic and historical accounts of  party leadership replacement in the UK (where until this last year single party governments have been the norm) and the Netherlands (where governments are generally multi-party coalitions.)    She followed this with successful trips to the both countries, where she was able to interview a cross-section of MPs at various career stages from various parties.  Flori is very friendly and outgoing; she is also energetic and organized.    People enjoy talking to her, and she clearly enjoys the interview process as well.  As a result,  her research trips have been extremely productive; she has amassed a good deal of information not only about how MPs and others think about party leaders, but also about the minute (but often consequential) details of the selection process.    There is a great deal of variety in the processes through which party leaders are selected: across and within countries, and across parties over time.  

Flori’s model of the selection of a new leader considers two cases: one in which those who select the party leader (the so-called “selectorate,” typically members of parliament and/or extraparliamentary activists) trade-off electoral appeal for policy position, and a second in which they are also concerned about reactions by party members who do not have a direct voice in the leadership question, but whose effort and enthusiasm is necessary for electoral success.    The models offer different testable predictions which can then be evaluated in the context of the very different party systems in the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.   Each country corresponds to a case that Flori’s model identifies as theoretically important:  in the UK and Sweden, the selectorate is generally less extreme than the rest of the party, in the Netherlands, they are ofter more extreme.   Sweden is characterized by regional divisions within the parties.   The UK is distinguished by the likelihood of single party control of government, which makes electoral success much more consequential than in countries with coalition government. 

Flori’s dissertation has three chapters drafted:  the multi-country analysis is quite polished; a case study of the UK is complete, needing only minor, non-substantive revising; the model has been solved with basic results derived but needs a fair amount of presentational work.   Her remaining tasks include incorporating analysis of the Netherlands and on Sweden.    These are not trivial tasks by any means, but  I am quite confident that she will be able to file her dissertation this summer. 

The choice of a party leader is one of the most salient things parties in parliamentary systems do.   Flori’s project promises to add much to our understanding of how this choice is made, and to our understanding of how parties mediate how governments respond to the interests and values of citizens and organized groups.  Flori is a promising scholar with bright career prospects.   She will make the best possible use of the opportunity you offer.  


Sincerely,

I have worked closely with her throughout her graduate career, and I continue to be in frequent contact with her now that I have relocated to Columbia University.  I have served as her instructor in a graduate research methods class, advised her research projects, and collaborated with her on three recent or forthcoming published articles.  Given our frequent interaction, I feel well-positioned to comment on Allie’s academic talents.

Allie is a truly outstanding student who will soon be an outstanding professor.  She is very smart, energetic, and professionally engaged.  During her first years as a grad student, it was apparent that she was willing to work twice as hard as her peers.  Her eagerness to learn was also apparent from the start; while pursuing a doctorate in political science, she undertook – and stuck with – an extremely rigorous degree program in Yale’s Economics Department.  And while taking some very challenging coursework, she somehow found time to collaborate on a wide range of different research projects in various subfields in political science.  Allie is really coming into her own as a researcher, with several important papers that will land in top journals.  Of special note are her recent co-authored papers on the statistical analysis of experiments with noncompliance and on the effects of (random) rotation of national leadership in international organizations.  Both required an eye for fruitful research opportunities and solid technical skills.

Thinking back on the papers that she and I have co-authored, I cannot have asked for a more astute or hardworking collaborator.  The manuscript that was eventually published in the American Journal of Political Science required an inventory and content analysis of more than one hundred articles in top journals that used instrumental variables regression.  This was a huge undertaking, especially since it required more than one reader’s evaluation of every article.  The fact that it was brought off with flair is a tribute to Allie’s formidable organizational skills and her talents as a perceptive critic of research design.

In sum, Allie is a talented researcher with very good technical skills.  She is continually looking for opportunities to learn and apply new methods.  I regard her as a perfect fit for PolMeth.","Green","Don","Professor","Columbia University","donald.p.green@gmail.com","212-854-0397","received","8310","Green","Don","Professor","Columbia University","donald.p.green@gmail.com","2128540397","approved","9047","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-06-09","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","1","1","1","","","WM","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

Tsung-han is doing absolutely cutting-edge work on the treatment of time-invariant and slowly changing
explanatory variables in a Bayesian context.  Why would political scientists care about this?  It turns out
that our ability to deal with stationary effects and rapidly changing effects is well-developed, but this
is an area that fits between these ideals.  Using time-series cross-sectional data, which are characterized
by having both intertemporal and cross-sectional effects, Mr. Tsai is able to control for unobserved
heterogeneity across units over time that can induce omitted variable bias when ignored.  This is a novel
and technically challenging approach that requires a deep understand of the mathematical-statistics involved
and the use Bayesian stochastic simulation.  

As this committee will know, a strength of the Washington University Department of Political Science has
been our methods training and our placement of methods students.  Tsung-han Tsai has technical skills that
place him amongst our very best.  In the Fall of 2009, he was the teaching assistant for my multilevel
models course, which had graduate students from both Arts \& Sciences as well as the School of Medicine.
In fact, it was taught in the Wohl Building on the medical campus.  As part of his TA duties I had him
run some sample models on the students' datasets each week to help them get started, including biomedical
examples.  Tsung-han not only ran sophisticated analyses of social science models, he also did the same for
medical/health models.  \emph{And}, he presented the results for 10 minutes at the beginning of class.  Not
many early-state political science graduate students could understand datasets provided by MDs \emph{and}
present the modeling results back to them.  This was truly impressive.","Gill","Jeff","Professor","Washington University","jgill@wustl.edu","314-825-3469","received","3945","","","","","","","pending","2561","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-05-17","2012-05-17","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","1","","","","1","","","","","MS","","","","","","","","49.5","","","299.50","mc_gross = 299.50

Alex Theodoridis is a promising PhD candidate in our department with a distinctly methodological bent, and I am happy to recommend him and his research.  He has been a regular at recent methods meetings, and he is ideally suited both to benefit from participating in this gathering and to contribute meaningfully to this summer’s meeting.

He is currently in the process of completing his dissertation and will be an assistant professor at the University of California, Merced starting this fall.  It is from his doctoral research that his poster proposal emerges.  His thesis is focused on improving our understanding of partisan identification by exploiting the conceptualization of this attachment as a social identity.  His work speaks especially to questions related to partisan intensity and its practical implications.  He has effectively tackled this topic, incorporating theory and methods from political science, statistics and psychology.  In particular, he has developed a specialization in the techniques of survey experimentation and in the statistical analysis required to analyze the resultant data, focusing especially on non-parametric methods.

His poster submission promises to advance our ability to effectively measure and understand partisan intensity.  The data from a set of survey experiments show partisan bias in settings not previously studied.  These findings are stronger than one might expect and provide more definitive evidence than previously existed, and I believe are an important contribution in and of themselves.  But, the primary focus in this study is a method Alex has employed to temporarily manipulate partisan identity using a battery of questions designed to make a respondent’s individual or collective self-concept more salient.  Alex uses the results of a 2x3 embedded experiment to show that partisans from the two parties show different levels of bias at baseline and that the manipulation produces very different effects among Democrats and Republicans.  Alex also systematically assesses the effectiveness of various measures of partisan intensity.  In particular, he applies a novel measure of partisan identity fusion and an implicit measure of attachment.  (With regard to the latter, Alex and I are both skeptical of the more common applications of the Implicit Association Test.  The IAT as Alex uses it avoids many of the problematic interpretation issues associated with the other valenced applications.  In Alex’s research, the IAT is used solely as a measure of cognitive association between the subject’s concept of “self” and a partisan target (Democrat/Republican).  The use of response latency for this sort of measurement is well established, but its application to party identity is novel and, I believe, represents an important advancement.)  

Alex’s overall substantive interests are in American electoral politics and political behavior/psychology.  In addition to his work on civic education and party identification, he has been involved in research on spatial analysis and community type, including his involvement in research by Jim Snyder and Steve Ansolabehere on the impact of the transition from malapportioned representation to “one person, one vote” on the urban-rural and liberal-conservative composition of the parties.  

Alex has also worked with Henry Brady on a project that involves the exploitation of a natural experiment to estimate the various factors in a voter’s decision to vote or abstain.  The analysis that Alex has conducted involved working with an extremely large dataset.  Through manipulations of the code for my GenMatch package, Alex was able to generate a matched sample from the raw data.  Then, despite the fact that the matched sample contained more than 1 billion observations, Alex was able to write a program to produce estimates, conduct tests of statistical significance and generate other values of interest.  This programming required a great deal of efficiency, despite the fact that Alex secured access to a machine in our Department of Statistics with 32 GB of memory.  Alex’s knowledge of statistics and scientific computing were not only demonstrated by this project, but they were also significantly expanded.  And, his experience analyzing such large datasets will become more and more valuable as the amount of data we must manipulate in social science continues to increase.  Alex is also currently collaborating with Brady on a methods paper designed to advance the applicability of stochastic dominance to the study of politics, including both experimental and observational data.

Driven by his substantive interests, Alex has shown a great deal of commitment to mastering the statistical and formal methods necessary for serious exploration in these areas.  This commitment predates his entry into our doctoral program.  As an MPP student at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, Alex pursued the most rigorous empirical methods and microeconomics sequence offered in that program.  He supplemented that curriculum with classes in regression, game theory and rational choice at the ICPSR Summer Program in Ann Arbor, as well as a course on survey research methods with Adam Berinsky at MIT. 

Since commencing his doctoral studies, Alex has continued to seek the best possible methodological training.  He took our department’s year-long formal modeling sequence under Robert Powell.  He has studied advanced econometrics and behavioral modeling with Henry Brady.  He took David Freedman’s graduate course on statistical models in the Berkeley Statistics Department.  He participated in Don Green’s workshop on field experiments at Yale and attended EITM at Michigan.   Alex has also extensively studied the use of fMRI methods in social neuroscience, his knowledge of which helped produce his recent Political Psychology article, “Of BOLD Claims and Excessive Fears: A Call for Caution and Patience Regarding Political Neuroscience.”  

Alex has also made valuable contributions as a citizen of our methods community at Berkeley.  He has repeatedly presented his research in my methods workshop.  He helped Sean Gailmard organize the 2010 EITM summer program in Berkeley.  He was the primary coordinator of two CCES modules (Berkeley and EITM).  He started the Berkeley Political Psychology Working Group.  This semester, he is the graduate student instructor for my advanced graduate-level Quantitative Methodology in the Social Sciences Seminar.

He brings to this research both a substantive mastery of his subject matter and a commitment to apply the most appropriate methods available to his inquiry.

Sharece is a talented graduate student with strong applied methods skills.  She already has a theory chapter of her dissertation under review at a major journal and has presented at national meetings a version of the empirical analysis that she hopes to present at methods.  

Sharece’s dissertation analyzes how the composition of the Supreme Court affects the executive branch’s unilateral powers.  Among other arguments, she suggests that as the Supreme Court’s ideological preferences become more similar to those of the president, the Court will be friendly to the expansion of executive power.  The dissertation tests this argument and other, related predictions of the theory (including ones that involve congressional preferences) on data involving presidential signing statements, executive orders, and administrative rule making.  In the chapter she proposes to present at methods, she focuses signing statements, i.e., whereby presidents issue written pronouncements about legislation when signing it.  A nice feature of this project is that Sharece can compare the implications of her theory for policy-oriented signing statements, which should be affected by the composition of the Supreme Court, versus symbolic ones that should not be related to the Court. In testing the theory, Sharece uses up-to-date statistical methods that address the “rare events” nature of signing statements in the data.

You should accept Sharece to the meetings simply because her research is top-notch.  Also, as an added bonus, Sharece as an African-American would presumably qualify for the NSF funds for historically under-represented groups.  However you fund her, you won’t be disappointed. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.","Canes-Wrone","Brandice","Professor","Princeton","bcwrone@princeton.edu","(609)258-9047","received","4737","","","","","","","","","0000-00-00","Accepted","","Yes","2012-05-17","0000-00-00","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","","","","","","","WM","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","","","Complete",2,1

Ph.D. student at Princeton for the summer methodology conference.
Carlos has completed the four-course quantitative methods sequence at
Princeton and was clearly the best student among about twenty students
of his cohort.  He and I have been working on several projects this
year, including the project with Gary King which evaluates the
electoral consequences of Seguro Popular, the Mexican universal health
insurance program, using the randomization of program implementation
across villages.  Carlos' primary field is the comparative political
economy and already has several working papers, which I think will be
published in a top journal in the near future.  One project, which he
presented last year at the polmeth conference, was the empirical
investigation of central bank decision making.  Carlos used a formal
theory and then constructed a mixture model to test competing
theories.  That paper is near the completion.  This year, he is
presenting a new project out of his dissertation research, which
examines the consequences of political dynasty using a clear natural
experiment in Europe.  I suspect that the members of political
methodology society will be impressed by the level of his
methodological sophistication and his ability to tackle substantively
important issues with clever use of quantitative methods.  In
conclusion, Carlos is a promising graduate student who I predict will
become a leading scholar of comparative political economy with an
impressive set of technical expertise in formal theory and
quantitative methods.  I urge the program committee to give him an
opportunity to present his research at the political methodology
conference poster session.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","4238","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","9644","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-06-06","2012-06-06","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","1","1","1","1","","","","","","MM","","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","198","Proposed poster presents co-authored work with Scott Abramson.

Letter of Recommendation for Matthew Charles Wilson

I am writing in support of Mr. Matthew Wilson’s application to the 2012 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. Mr. Wilson is a third-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Penn State University. I have known Mr. Wilson for two years, as his professor and advisor. I recommend him highly. 

Mr. Wilson was a student in my PLSC 551 Comparative Political Institutions graduate seminar, during Spring 2010. In this class, we focused on democracy and democratization. His research design paper combined two of his interests: conflict (whether certain regime types are more likely to engage in civil war) and methods (shortcomings in current measures of democracy). He earned an A as his grade for the graduate seminar.   After the class, Mr. Wilson used his seminar paper as the basis for his MA thesis. His thesis looked at the limitations of three commonly used datasets (Cheibub et al. 2010, Hadenius and Teorell 2077, and Wright 2008) that measure authoritarian regimes. Using case studies from Latin America, he showed that although the authors claimed to measure the same concept, they disagreed on coding critical cases. These differences led to significantly different results when utilized in models of civil conflict. He successfully defended his MA thesis in Spring 2011. That same semester, Mr. Wilson was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP), for three years.

Based on his performance in my seminar and his MA thesis, I suggested that we co-author a series of conference papers based on data from my book-length project. Our papers analyze actors’ behavior in forty-two national crises in twelve countries from 1950-1999 to see whether different patterns of cooperation or conflict are associated with different regime types. We applied sequence analysis to cluster the crises based on the actors’ levels of cooperation and conflict.  Over two-thirds of our sample clustered into two distinct groups that differed in the level and duration of conflict as well as regime type.  Furthermore, three factors were associated with these patterns of clustering: need, group support, and type of crisis.  We presented a paper at the 2011 American Political Science Association (APSA) meeting and will present a second paper at the 2012 Midwest Political Science Association. We have submitted a third paper proposal for the 2012 APSA meeting. Mr. Wilson and I will serve as co-authors on the poster that have proposed for the 2012 Summer Meeting. 

These conference papers/poster are related not only to my work but also to Mr. Wilson’s dissertation on the effect of political sequencing on democratization. Is the timing of democratization dependent on the sequencing or on the accumulation of certain factors? Democratic sequencing and path dependence are key issues in discussions regarding how democratization occurs and whether the resulting democracies will consolidate. Mr. Wilson’s research will apply a technique rarely used in political science – sequence analysis – and compare it to more conventional methods such as duration models. Using both approaches will allow him to show which factors have the greatest effect on democratization and on democratic stability. 

If I can be of any further help, or answer any questions, please feel free to contact me. I can be reached by phone, at (814) 865-8748; by fax, at (814) 863-8979; or via e-mail, at gcasper@psu.edu.

Sincerely,

She is in the top group of students in the class, doing well at all aspects of the class. Even as a G1, she has taken an impressive array of statistical courses, including our entire graduate sequence, MIT’s graduate methods sequence (as an undergraduate), and RA experience with several faculty. 

Her project, with another student in my class, is about the Occupy movement and other related examples of the spontaneous formulation of political community and interests. It has many interesting methodololgical implications. 

I strongly support her application. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information.

In the summer and fall he was working independently (that is, he did almost all of the work on his own; I was available as a backup but needed to do almost nothing) as a consultant for the National Geospatial Agency on statistical modeling of disaster response to hurricanes and did an excellent job of this.

The proposed project is taking off from some earlier work that Jay was doing with Vito D'Orazio on event sequence matching -- which was presented at MPSA in 2011 -- but is switching to an unsupervised learning approach (Vito and Jay had earlier been using some semi-parametric techniques which were not matched to the data as well as they might be). Jay is already quite familiar with both the data processing demands from that earlier project, and the relevant methods based on his machine-learning coursework, and the issue is simply putting these together and seeing what develops. I am completely confident that he will have some completed original work by the time of the summer meeting, and based on earlier presentations I have seen him give before professional audiences, I am just as confident that he will do a very good job of presenting that. He thus has my very strong endorsement for participation in the summer meeting.","Schrodt","Philip","Professor","Pennsylvania State University","schrodt@psu.edu","Skype [in Norway] philschrodt","received","7925","Schrodt","Philip","Professor","Pennsylvania State University","schrodt@psu.edu","Skype [in Norway]: philschrodt","approved","2984","0000-00-00","Accepted","250.00","Yes","2012-05-31","2012-05-31","","","","","2012-05-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","Yes","MM","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","0","","","250.00","mc_gross = 250.00
