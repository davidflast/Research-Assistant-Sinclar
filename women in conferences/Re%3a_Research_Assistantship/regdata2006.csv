themselves politically, the desire to vote must be acquired, either by
learning about the candidates, by using party identification as a cognitive
shortcut, or by contact from a trusted source.  Modeled as Bayesian
updating, this simple explanatory framework has dramatic implications for
the understanding of voter turnout. It mathematically implies the main
empirical generalizations familiar from the literature, it predicts
hitherto unnoticed patterns that appear in turnout data, and it implies a new statistical specification for modeling turnout, which fits better. Thus the case is
strengthened for the Bayesian voter model as a central organizing principle

In particular, voters whose first preference has only minority support may vote strategically for a candidate they prefer less but with greater support among other voters.  Approval voting allows these minority voters to vote for their first preference as well as less preferred candidates who they believe may garner more support.  Thus, we expect approval voting to encourage more sincere voting choices. This paper presents experiments testing this prediction. In the experiments approval voting is compared to two ranked procedures (Borda count and Hare systems) and one unranked rules (Plurality voting).  In the experiments there are four candidates and five different types of voters (that is, preference orderings). The results support predictions.

He has strong training in political methodology, and he has served as Methods Fellow in the department‚??s Program in Statistics and Methodology.

Roman‚??s work probes the relationship between Congress and the Supreme Court in public policy making.  It takes a distinctive theoretical position on the relationship.  Roman‚??s planned tests of hypotheses based on that theoretical position reflect his methodological expertise, and they are innovative in some important respects.

The dissertation focuses on the Court-Congress relationship in constitutional law.  Roman departs from the standard ‚??separation of powers‚?ù models in treating the Court rather than Congress as having the last word in the interaction between the two branches.  He also departs from the nearly universal assumption that members of the two branches act only on the basis of their preferred ideological positions.  He argues that justices and members of Congress also seek to maximize what he calls the suitability of legislation, its effectiveness in achieving the goals that underlie it; one key element of suitability is the consistency of legislation with the Constitution.

Roman has built a formal model of Court-Congress interaction on these assumptions, and he derived from the model a series of hypotheses about the determinants of each branch‚??s behavior that will be tested in the dissertation.  His measurement of independent variables required considerable innovation.  His theory gives importance to variables that are difficult to measure: the suitability of statutes, the intensity of congressional preferences, the level of congressional resources for change in policy, and the price to Congress of ideological change and of improvements in the suitability of statutes.  As his proposal shows, Roman has developed reasonable measures of these concepts, and his measures reflect considerable insight on his part.

Nearly all existing tests of hypotheses about Court-Congress interaction focus only on Supreme Court decisions on the merits and on the statutes that the Court considers in those decisions.  Roman recognized that these restrictions incorporate significant selection effects that may bias the results.  In response, he is looking not only at cases in which the Court determines whether a federal statute is unconstitutional but also at the much larger number of cases in which a statute is challenged but the Court chooses not to hear the case.  On the congressional side, he examines a random sample of statutes rather than just those that become the subject of Court decisions.  Because of these steps, his analyses will avoid the selection effects that may have distorted the findings of existing studies.

Roman‚??s analysis of predictions about the Supreme Court‚??s behavior is particularly exciting in methodological terms.  He is extending analytic methods that have received little use in political science.  His employment of those methods will allow him to take into account the non-random sample of statutes that are challenged in the Supreme Court. His project combines two important techniques in survival analysis:  frailty models to account for unobserved heterogeneity and cure models to allow for the possibility that not all observation will experience the event of interest.  Almost all applications of duration modeling in political science violate the assumption that all observations will eventually fail and thus the need for extensions to the basic cure model.  His work provides a natural extension of both frailty and cure models by allowing for unobserved heterogeneity among those observations that will eventually experience the event and builds upon the important work of Aalen (1992), Aalen and Tretly (1999), and Moger and Aalen (2005).  His methodological work is analytic and uses Monte Carlos, which is a hallmark of most methodologists today. Importantly, his methodological work not only has application to other fields of political science, but to all disciplines in which duration modeling is used.

Part of his work in this role is consultation with graduate students who have questions for the dissertations or papers as well as faculty who have questions.  It is a role he has filled admirably and it has entailed both methodological presentations (for example on the recent developments in the literature on simultaneous equations) and software presentations (such as using R). He has a long list of courses that have served him well in terms of breadth, including dimensional analysis, time series, survey research, and a host of econometric courses. He also works hard to make his work, and that of his graduate student colleagues interpretable so that the substantive implications of his work is apparent to all.  Cory is outgoing and we expect him to contribute more than the average graduate student to the dialogue of the conference. It would be very useful for him to get reactions at the conference to his poster, which presents his dissertation research, and it is good timing in terms of where he is at in the program. He will be on the job market this fall.  He has clearly already made the transition from being a most capable graduate student to being a most promising young scholar.

Can we use matching methods to compare precincts in the ‚??treatment‚?ù county with similar ones in another county?  What kind of matching methods should we use and how should we incorporate geography into our matching? More generally, how can we use geographic information to enhance our ability to make causal inferences?  This paper explores these questions by developing an evaluation of the Los Angeles County Inka-Vote system‚??a ""Votomatic style"" punch card system adapted to optical scanning technology‚??that was used in 2004 and 2005.  

The first part of the paper provides an overview of the existing methods for evaluating the performance of voting systems and for detecting voting irregularities. In addition to using scatter plots, regression methods, and difference-in-difference designs, we suggest the use of matching methods and Geographic Information Science (GIS) tools. Intuitively, precincts that are geographically adjacent share many similar socio-economic and demographic characteristics. If all voting systems perform in the same manner, one would expect the residual vote rates of adjacent precincts along the border of two counties to be roughly similar.  We explore whether adjacent precincts split by a county line are really similar, whether residual vote rates in border precincts do differ between Los Angeles County and its adjoining counties, and whether geographic propinquity adds inferential leverage beyond matching methods that are based upon Census information for precincts.  

Answering these questions requires overcoming several challenges. First, electoral returns are available at the precinct level while Census demographic characteristics are measured at the block (or block-group level). This is a common problem in social science research as political or social geography rarely follows Census geography.  We demonstrate two methods, namely area calculation and spatial spline, for addressing this problem. Second, in order to identify precincts that are spatially adjacent, we will use network analysis to obtain more accurate measurement of physical distance. Third, we will take up a methodological question -‚?? should physical distance play a role in matching? In a spatial context, does physical distance serve as a good proxy for the measurement of precinct characteristics that are not adequately measured by Census data?  Do we get the same or different results if we include physical distance as a matching factor in addition to Census information?

Similar concerns were raised by Democrats following the landslide election of 1984. Are these concerns correct? Do early media projections of the presidential winner affect turnout or election outcomes? Contrary to much of the popular wisdom and previous academic research, I present evidence suggesting that the early media projections of the winner do not affect turnout, the vote share in the presidential race, or the vote share in the congressional races. 

The advantage of this study over previous research is that I leverage the natural experiment created in Kentucky where there are two time zones and the networks have projected the election winner after polls in the eastern part of the state have closed but while polls in the western half are still open. Comparing precincts within a state, confounding factors such as state laws, other statewide races, etc., are controlled for. Further, I match precincts in the treatment group to similar precincts in the control group based on registration data to improve the quality of the counterfactuals used in estimating the average treatment effects.

Modeling the List Experiment with LISTIT","Many of the social phenomena we are most interested in are also extremely difficult to study via surveys when people lie about or otherwise hide socially unacceptable or incriminating behaviors.  To measure sensitive behaviors and opinions, I present an unobtrusive measure called a list experiment (originally Kuklinski et al.), which I have improved and extended to enable multivariate analysis via the new LISTIT statistical estimator. The procedure, briefly, splits the survey sample into control and treatment groups. The former receives a series of non-sensitive yes/no questions to be answered individually. The latter receives the same set of non-sensitive questions plus one sensitive question in a list format, and are asked how many of the list items they do/believe, and specifically not which ones. Appropriate statistical analysis allows us to estimate the determinants of the sensitive opinion in the population without ever knowing which individual survey respondents actually hold the sensitive opinion. I first detail the derivation of the new statistical estimator, and then demonstrate the procedure with original survey data collected in Lebanon in 2005, using items on restrictions on the suffrage, willingness to live in mixed neighborhoods, and participation in the pro-/anti-Syrian demonstrations in the spring of 2005.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-28","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-08","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

The technique used is fractional hot deck imputation; because the imputed value is a draw from the conditional distribution of the variable with the missing observation, the discrete nature of the variable is maintained as its missing values are imputed. Multiple imputation, as it is typically practiced, should not be run on discrete data because it assumes continuity and replaces missing discrete values with nonsensical non-discrete values; a binary variable for gender might be imputed with a value of .6 with traditional multiple imputation. The problem of nonsensical imputations for discrete data worsens the less continuous the data are. The primary weakness of traditional hot decking as compared with multiple imputation, an inability to make confidence statements about the imputed values, is overcome by weighting imputed values by the fraction of the original weight of the missing element assigned to the value of the donor observation based on its degree of affinity with the incomplete observation. The proposed poster will detail the mathematics of fractional hot deck imputation as well a R package to accomplish it which is currently under development.

As in other democratic countries, however, self-reported voting in surveys is overstated.  In 2000, for example, the National Poll on Political Culture and Citizen Practices showed 81% turnout, but the official election returns, only 64%.  

As elsewhere, the sources of this phenomenon are two:  respondents may falsely report having voted, and the sample may overrepresent those who did vote (a matter of  selection bias).  The overestimation matters not only for description and cross-national comparison, but because the nonrandom errors involved may bias individual-level estimations of the influences on voting.  If, for example, either claiming falsely to have voted or turning up in the sample is positively related to income (which is positively related to voting), income's effects on the probability of voting will be overestimated.

In the U.S., the National Election Study sometimes validates claims of voting by comparing them to official voting records, a costly but simple expedient, but in Mexico this solution is unavailable.  Ballot materials are destroyed six months after the election and federal law prohibits release of individual voting information.  Validated vote data are thus unobtainable.    

That leaves several other possibilities.  Using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) 2000 Mexican survey, this paper tries and examines the implications of three corrective methods.  The first is to use survey ‚??filter questions‚?ù to reclassify people who claim to have voted but could not have done so.  For example, I recategorize as non-voters those who claimed to have voted but whose voter credentials were not marked by polling officials and then rerun the analysis on the reclassified sample.  

The second approach is to down-weight respondents claiming to have voted, on the expectation that people who say they didn‚??t vote are telling the truth more often than those who say they did. The probability of actually voting, conditional on sociodemographic characteristics like age, sex, and income, can be estimated by combining census data with official turnout figures and by exit polls.  I use these estimates to form sample weights.  

The third approach, following Brehme (2001), is to estimate Heckman-type selection models with auxiliary information to correct for ""stochastic truncation"", or unit non-response, in which we have no information on non-respondents.  I use aggregate data to estimate a ‚??dose-probit‚?ù selection model.  (Since the inverse Mills ratio is based on aggregate, rather than individual, data I call the method a ""Heckman-type"" method.)  Then I incorporate these estimates into the outcome model, using post-election surveys, to examine the causes of voting.  

The results suggest that prior studies have generally overemphasized the impact of sociodemographic variables on voting.  With the biases from turnout overestimation are corrected for, political attitudes‚??especially trust that the elections are clean and fair‚??appear to predict voting better than income, education, or age.

A hypothesis that follows from this result is that voters discount the extreme positions taken by a politician on issues her party owns, while weighting more heavily the positions the politician takes on issues her party does not own.  To test this hypothesis, we use matching methods to re-analyze the dataset on Congressional roll-call votes and election returns from 1956 through 1996 assembled by Canes-Wrone, Brady and Cogan (AJPS 2002).  Our analysis indicates that their key finding--that members of Congress who take extreme positions are punished for doing so by voters--rests heavily on their model's assumed functional form, and fails to hold under the non-parametric matching approach.  However, we do find support for our issue-ownership hypothesis: voters punish politicians who take extreme positions, but only on issues their parties do not own.  We conclude with a discussion of the substantive and methodological issues raised by our analysis.

I develop two different error structures that unit heterogeneity can imply in the logistic QRE model (based on the distribution of information in the game), show that ignoring these effects biases the estimation of observable parameters, and develop appropriate corrections using a variant of the fixed effects estimator. I show that unit parameters can be directly estimated with reasonable reliability in cases where the objective utility payoffs are known (e.g., in laboratory experiments,) allowing researchers the opportunity to directly measure the magnitude of altruism and greed implied by behavior.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-27","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-04","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

I show that the degree of preference alignment, or bias, can influence the outcome of major power-organized settlement talks by revealing private information about whether or not the major power is committed to enforcing an agreement through the use of force. A non-monotonic relationship between bias and the outcome of the intervention exists: When bias is high, a peaceful outcome is more likely because the embattled parties are more certain the intervener is resolute. By contrast, when the degree of bias is middling, negotiations are more inclined to fail because the adversaries believe the intervener may be incapable of punishing the disfavored party if it fails to settle. When bias is low, a peaceful outcome is again more likely because the intervener seeks to locate agreements both adversaries find acceptable.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-03-01","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-17","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","hotel/other","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the strength of ties between each legislator by examining their effect on cosponsorship decisions. Our procedure simultaneously estimates two-dimensional ideal points for each legislator and the effect of party membership, committee membership, leadership positions, seniority, and geographic contiguity on cosponsorship.

ABSTRACT:
This project considers the specification, estimation, and interpretation of empirical models that reflect spatial (and spatio-temporal) interdependence among observations. We introduce and discuss four common estimators for spatial-lag models: non-spatial OLS, spatial OLS, spatial 2SLS-IV, and spatial ML. We first contrast three possible sources of spatial correlation: correlated unit-specific explanators, correlated exogenous-external explanators, and interdependence. We introduce a generic empirical model with spatial lag, unit-specific and exogenous-external shocks, and the interaction of the latter two. Such a model corresponds to modern theoretical and substantive expectations in political science and highlights the empirical difficulty of distinguishing the possible sources of spatial correlation (‚??Galton‚??s Problem‚?ù). We introduce and discuss in this context several tests for spatially correlated data and explain how they, unlike spatial-lag models, are incapable of distinguishing among the possible sources of spatial correlation. We next derive analytically the respective omitted-variable and simultaneity biases of the OLS estimators for spatial-lag models in the simplest possible case of two units and two independent variables. We then demonstrate the bias, efficiency, and standard-error-accuracy performance of the OLS, IV, and ML estimators in a wide range of realistically richer-model and limited-sample simulation environments. We explore, first, data-generating processes and empirical specifications with common exogenous-external shocks and uniform interdependence among spatial units. The spatial lag in this case amounts to the (unweighted) average of the dependent variable in the other units, thereby representing a ‚??rough & ready‚?ù spatial-lag proxy to which empirical researchers often resort. This case also exhibits an extreme manifestation of ‚??Galton‚??s Problem‚?ù given the close similarity of uniform interdependence and common exogenous-external shocks. We evaluate the four estimators first when the empirical specification matches the true data-generating process; then with measurement/specification error in the empirical specification of the spatial-interdependence pattern; and then, in the case of the IV estimator, with imperfectly exogenous instruments under varying magnitudes of spatial correlation and endogeneity among right- and left-hand-side variables. Finally, we repeat these simulation exercises for several realistically non-homogenous patterns of spatial-interdependence literally drawn directly from the substantive literature; i.e., we draw matrices of interdependence patterns for our experimental consideration directly from actual datasets containing that information used in the literature. One pattern reflects international trade relations among the units; another reflects ‚??common memberships‚?ù (e.g., in organizations, language or cultural groups, etc.) among the units; a third reflects the geographic or otherwise spatial distance between the units; and the fourth and final pattern reflects strategic-complement (coopoerative) and -substitute (competitive) relations between the units. Penultimately, we conduct a series of replications and extensions of existing work using spatial lags or failing to use them when theory and substance explicitly demand them (e.g., Hays 2003, Swank and Steinmo 2002, Basinger and Hallerberg 2004), and we offer also an entirely new analysis of the strategic interdependence among EU governments in domestic active-labor-market policymaking (Franzese and Hays 2006). Finally, we show how to calculate, and offer suggestions on presenting, estimates of spatio-temporal effects and dynamics and their standard errors (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, etc.).","Jude C.

These three factors have an important effect on vote margin while also being contingent upon the perceived margin of votes. For example, if a high quality challenger enters the race, the incumbent's lead will decrease. On the other hand, if the challenger party expects that the incumbent's lead is small, it is likely to field a high quality candidate. Failure to take this ''simultaneity bias problem'' into consideration leads to bias in estimates. Scholars of electoral studies have not fully addressed this problem (Cox and Katz 2002, Gelman and King 1990).
 
This paper models actors' decisions as a Nash equilibrium. From this formal model, I directly derive the joint distribution of the four dependent variables: vote margin, incumbent retirement, challenger's quality, and fund-raising margin. Since my model takes into account endogeneity among these variables, estimates are free from bias. I will show unbiasedness of my estimator by Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, an application of my model to U.S. House election data is demonstrated.

Through this process I reconsider other issues as well. First, election analysts usually use the vote margin from the previous election as an independent variable. I maintain, however, that the implication of a prior vote margin is dependent on the specifics of how that election was fought over. For example, a favorably large prior vote margin against a high quality challenger is a better prospect than if the challenger was of low quality. Thus, we should measure the implication of a prior vote margin by considering the circumstances of that election. Secondly, suppose, for example, that the U.S. is in a boom economy and the Republicans control the presidency and both houses of Congress. In this situation, weak Republican candidates attract more fund-raising than strong ones. Conversely, weak Democratic candidates attract less fund-raising than strong ones. This pattern is empirically known, theoretically reasonable, but not yet formally explained. I formally show why this is the case.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-26","Accepted","","Yes","2006-03-23","2006-03-23","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","200","",""

First let me explain methodological improvement. Preceding studies of approval have employed the linear normal model. This model, however, is flawed in two ways. First, the old model inadvertently does not take into account the fact that approval rate falls between 0 and 100. Second, scholars implicitly assume that respondents' propensities to approve the government are homogeneous, while it would sound more plausible to think that they are heterogeneous. For example, Democrats may well tend to approve a Democrat president rather than Republicans. Thus, I propose a new model, the logit modified extended beta binomial model. This model not only addresses boundedness of approval rate and citizen's heterogeneity, but also predicts that the heterogeneity of a citizen's attitude, particularly the presence of non partisan voters or lack of information, makes approval rate more volatile.

My paper also sheds a new light on substantial aspects of approval rate. Political scientists have shown that several political and economic factors explain approval rate: party support, change of government, duration of government, and economic performance indicators - such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment. Though I also use them as explanatory variables, this work adds two new causes of popularity to the literature: favored international circumstances and a chief executive's youth.

I apply this model to data gathered monthly within Japanese from 1960 to 2004. The results show that the rate of non partisan voters increase the variance of approval rate; when more people are in favor of the United States, the cabinet becomes more popular, and younger prime ministers win more of the citizens' support.

ecological data with subsample data in 
situations in which a linear model is 
appropriate provides two main benefits. 
First, by including the individual level 
subsample data, the biases associated with 
linear ecological inference can be 
eliminated. Second, we can use readily 
available ecological data to design optimal 
subsampling schemes, so as to maximize 
information about parameters. We present an 
application of this methodology to the 
classic problem of estimating the effect of 
a college degree on wages. We show that 
combining ecological data with subsample 
data provides precise estimates of this 
value, and that optimal subsampling schemes 
(conditional on the ecological data) can 
provide good precision with only a fraction 
of the observations.

Cross-national time-series datasets, particularly those encompassing less-developed countries, are notoriously plagued by incompleteness, yet are not easily adaptable to models of missingness developed for survey and census data.

There are of course less rigorous, albeit ad hoc, methods of filling in incomplete data, commonly employed by applied practitioners.  The techniques of mean imputation and interpolation are often employed to replace missingness, while many researchers simply fill in the unobserved data with their personal best guesses.  All three of these improvised statistical devices often seem to work, and rest on some reasonable underlying assumptions:  many national measures change slowly over time, observations at the mean of the data do not change slopes in linear models, and expert knowledge prior to the dataset can be a useful predictor of missing observations.

Applied researchers then, often choose between a rigorous model of missingness, predicated on assumptions that are clearly incorrect for their data, or ad hoc methods whose underlying assumptions are much more reasonable.  We present a model of missingness that incorporates the frameworks that allow interpolation and expert knowledge to work, when they work.

We present several key innovations.  [1] We construct a model of missingness that allows for trends in time across observations within a cross-sectional unit, formalizing the intuition of interpolation when interpolation has predictive power.  [2] We couple to this a system of observation-driven priors to allow experts to incorporate the prior information they have at their disposal, in the terms they are most easily able to communicate it.  [3] All existing multiple imputation software using rigorous methods crashes with some regularity and is particularly error-prone with large numbers of variables and high degrees of missingness.  We show how a modification of an existing algorithm with a bootstrapping technique can greatly expand the range of data types and size of data sets that can be handled without difficulty.  As a companion to this paper we make available new open source software that implements all the methods in this paper and virtually never crashes.  [4]  We present a useful diagnostic of the fit of multiple imputation models, and show some examples of how our innovations improve this fit over standard imputation models in the literature of development.

I am writing a letter to recommend that Lisa Blaydes be granted a spot to attend this summer's Methods meeting.  Although Lisa is a quantitatively savy graduate student in our department, I believe that Lisa has never attended the methods meetings, and this is probably her last year as a graduate student.

Lisa's work is on Middle East politics, a subject and subfield that does not often receive a quantitative focus.  Lisa's work has bounced back and forth between data analytic and more traditional substantive, textual readings of events.  This is a field that needs more empirical work, and with some investment in Lisa on the part of the section, she may be socialized into spearheading it.  Lisa is certainly quantitatively savy enough to gain a lot of useful insights from the discussions at methods.  I think she would be at the median level of the graduate students who attend, and would be more likely to export and communicate the techniques from the conference to fields it might not otherwise reach.

Past researchers typically use county- or even state-level demographics as proxies for a respondent‚??s local environment, and they rarely incorporate information about a respondent‚??s past environments.  There is, then, a significant gap between our theories of contextual influence‚??which suggest that context‚??s influence should grow with time‚??and our estimates of contextual influence, which ignore the period of time spent in the current locality.  Also, past work usually deals with the selection bias induced by residential mobility only by explaining it away: rarely are attempts made to estimate that bias directly.  This paper makes use of 2004 American National Election Study data, including restricted geographic information, to provide more accurate estimates of the impact of racial and ethnic contexts on respondents‚?? attitudes about taxing and spending.  Methodologically, it draws on recent advances in matching techniques to isolate the distinctive influence of local contexts.  By employing tract-level and municipal-level contextual data alongside county-level data, this paper illustrates the extent to which county-level estimates of context can be misleading.  It concludes that selection bias does not explain much of the observed correlation between local ethnic and racial diversity and attitudes toward taxation, and that moving to a more diverse environment does indeed dampen one‚??s support for taxing and for many forms of government spending.

Can we use matching methods to compare precincts in the ‚??treatment‚?ù county with similar ones in another county?  What kind of matching methods should we use and how should we incorporate geography into our matching? More generally, how can we use geographic information to enhance our ability to make causal inferences?  This paper explores these questions by developing an evaluation of the Los Angeles County Inka-Vote system‚??a ‚??Votomatic style punch card system adapted to optical scanning technology‚??that was used in 2004 and 2005.  

The first part of the paper provides an overview of the existing methods for evaluating the performance of voting systems and for detecting voting irregularities. In addition to using scatter plots, regression methods, and difference-in-difference designs, we suggest the use of matching methods and Geographic Information Science (GIS) tools. Intuitively, precincts that are geographically adjacent share many similar socio-economic and demographic characteristics. If all voting systems perform in the same manner, one would expect the residual vote rates of adjacent precincts along the border of two counties to be roughly similar.  We explore whether adjacent precincts split by a county line are really similar, whether residual vote rates in border precincts do differ between Los Angeles County and its adjoining counties, and whether geographic propinquity adds inferential leverage beyond matching methods that are based upon Census information for precincts.  

Answering these questions requires overcoming several challenges. First, electoral returns are available at the precinct level while Census demographic characteristics are measured at the block (or block-group level). This is a common problem in social science research as political or social geography rarely follows Census geography.  We demonstrate two methods, namely area calculation and spatial spline, for addressing this problem. Second, in order to identify precincts that are spatially adjacent, we will use network analysis to obtain more accurate measurement of physical distance. Third, we will take up a methodological question‚??does physical distance play a role in matching? In a spatial context, does physical distance serve as a good proxy for the measurement of precinct characteristics that are not adequately measured by Census data?  Do we get the same or different results if we include physical distance as a matching factor in addition to Census information?

Princeton, NJ 08544","609-258-6601","","kimai@Princeton.Edu","Paper Proposal","Quantifying Missing Information in Ecological Inference","Ecological inference is a statistical problem 
where aggregate-level data are used to make 
inferences about individual-level behavior.
Recent years have witnessed resurgent 
interest in ecological inference among 
political methodologists and statisticians. 
Most of the existing research, however, has 
focused on the development of new parametric
models and the criticism of existing models. 
Indeed, the literature has generated numerous 
debates over the appropriateness of proposed
methods and their use.

In this paper, we directly address the 
fundamental source of the methodological 
disagreements by quantifying the amount of 
missing information in ecological inference.  
The difficulty of ecological inference 
originates in the indeterminacy caused by 
data aggregation. Applying theoretical 
results from the statistical literature on 
the analysis of missing data, we show how to 
formally measure the amount of information 
the observed aggregate-level data provide in 
comparison with the information one would 
obtain if the individual-level data were 
available.

We first propose a statistical framework 
which formulates ecological inference as a 
missing data problem. Under this general 
theoretical framework, we develop new 
parametric models and computational methods
that can be used to estimate the fraction of 
missing information in the context of both 
parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. 
For parameter estimation, we compare the 
observed-data information matrix with the 
complete-data information matrix. A high 
fraction of missing information flags a 
warning to applied researchers that the 
resulting inferences may heavily depend on 
the modeling assumptions and hence be 
unreliable.  For hypothesis testing, we 
compute the ratio of the likelihood test 
statistics under the observed-data and 
complete-data models. This directly measures 
the relative amount of missing information in 
terms of the evidence against the null 
hypothesis of interest. We propose new 
Expectation-Maximization algorithms, which
can be used to compute these measures under 
a variety of modeling assumptions.

Previous studies largely relied on informal 
graphical and numerical summaries of the 
bounds to examine the amount of information 
available in the observed data. In contrast, 
our proposed methods can be used to formally 
assess the severity of aggregation effects in 
any data set of interest. We also provide 
easy-to-use statistical software so that
applied researchers can employ our methods to 
evaluate the impact of data aggregation on 
their own ecological research.

The use of a split pop model allows evaluating the probability of never experiencing the event in question, and it allows estimating the effects of covariates on duration for those cases that have a chance of experiencing the event.  One of the assumptions made by a split-pop model is homogeneity of duration among the susceptible observations.  A different approach to modeling event history data is by taking into account the unobserved heterogeneity across individual cases, which is accomplished by including the frailty component.  Usually, the frailty term is assumed to follow the gamma or inverse Normal distribution, neither of which allows observations to have zero risks.  This creates a problem should one need to estimate a duration model that accounts both for the proportion of the individuals that will never experience the event and for the unobserved heterogeneity.
Thus, although the split pop framework accounts for some degree of heterogeneity, failure to properly account for unobserved variance can create distorted results.  Conversely, incorrect results could be produced by a frailty model that does not allow for a non-susceptible group of observations.
Two recent developments in biostatistical literature allow a combination of frailty and cure approaches.  The use of the compound Poisson distribution allows statistical modeling of zero frailty (Aalen, 1992).  Aalen (1992) suggests thinking about the compound Poisson frailty as a sum of random shocks each of which is randomly distributed.  A frailty term of zero corresponds to a zero risk of experiencing the event.  This corresponds to a zero probability of experiencing the event in the usual split-pop setting.  Using interrelationships between the Laplace transforms and survivor functions allows one to account for frailty and derive a relatively straightforward likelihood function.  Longinin and Halloran (1996) and Price and Manatunga (2001) offer a different approach by keeping the probability of never experiencing the event separately from the frailty term.  With some probability an observations will be non-susceptible, and with the complement of this probability, an observation will be susceptible and suffer from heterogeneity.  The frailty mixture approach allows separate statistical modeling of probabilities of belonging to the group that will never experience the event in question and duration until the event for susceptible observations demonstrating heterogeneity. 
This project extends the works of Aalen (1992) and Price and Manatunga (2001) by combining the frailty and split-pop analyses and applying them to a subfield of political science.  This methodological approach allows a reexamination of the interactions between Congress and Supreme Court.  Majority of federal statutes are likely to be never overturned by Supreme Court, thus, the split-pop approach seems to be well suited.  Additionally, one needs to take into account the unobserved heterogeneity across the statutes that have a positive probability of being overturned.  Therefore, the combination of frailty and split-pop analyses seems especially appropriate in the study of Court-Congress interactions.
	The goal of this project is to analyze the duration to invalidation of federal statutes by the U.S. Supreme Court while accounting for both the probability of no invalidation (non-controversial legislation) and unobserved heterogeneity across individual observations.  The unit of analysis is a federal statute.  The observations are statutes passed by Congress since the mid 1980‚??s.  Similarly to Harvey and Friedman (2006), this analysis will concentrate on the influence that political predilections of the pivotal members of the Court and Congress, as well as the threat of legislative invalidation, might have on the duration until invalidation; however, this project will extend the cure model of Harvey and Friedman (2006) to include unobserved heterogeneity across federal statutes.  Both the compound Poisson model and the frailty mixture model will be estimated.  The flexibility of the frailty mixture approach will allow estimation of the time to invalidation as well as the probability of belonging to the group of laws that will never be invalidated.

This year Doug Rivers, Jonathan Wand and I would like to bring THREE students to PolMeth06 up in Davis.  We're happy to pick up their expenses etc.  I'll submit an on-line application for each of them.

Alex Tahk: Alex is the most naturally gifted methodology student I've encountered anywhere.  He is just very very clever, and a very hard worker.  He has a couple of awesome working papers at the moment that will be going out for review shortly on the roll-call problem.  Not only is he the best methods student in our pipeline, but he is currently probably the best student in Stanford's Statistics PhD program as well.  Along with Stephen Jessee, he has written a very nice set of programs etc to update beliefs about the preferences of Supreme Court Justices in quasi-real time, learning about the preferences of the two newest members of the Court, Roberts and Alito (re-running an ideal point algorithm as new decisions are published, pushing the results/graphs to the web etc).  On pure smarts and statistical know-how, I'd put Alex up against any political science graduate student in the country right now, and many professors for that matter.  He is a rising star, and I hope we can find a place for him at the Summer Meeting.

Bush","We use a Bayesian dynamic linear model to track approval for George W.~Bush over time. Our analysis deals with several issues that have been usually addressed separately in the extant literature.  

First, our model utilizes the (now-standard) error-correction representation of the dynamics in approval: change in presidential approval tracks changes in macro-economic conditions, save for disequilibrating shocks from scandals and foreign policy crises (aka ""rally'' events).  This convenient partitioning of variables into
long-term and short-term sources of variation in approval is not so clear-cut in the case of George W.~Bush: events such as the ongoing war in Iraq, increases in gasoline prices, and unfavorable reactions to the government's handling of Hurriance Katrina do not fall neatly
into the category of short-term disequilibriating shocks to approval.  Thus, we test competing models of dynamics in Bush's approval, assessing the status of these events (transient shocks to Bush approval, or folded into a ``running tally'' of assessments for Bush).

Second, our analysis uses polling data collected at a higher frequency than is typical, using over 1,000 published national polls, and data on macro-economic conditions collected at the weekly level.  By combining this much poll information, we are much better poised to
examine the public's reactions to events over shorter time scales than can the typical analysis of approval that utilizes monthly or quarterly time series on approval and economic data.

Third, our statistical modeling explicitly deals with the sampling error of these polls, as well as the possibility of bias in the polls due to house effects.  Indeed, quite aside from the question of ``what drives approval?'', there is considerable interest in the extent to which polling organizations systematically diverge from one another in
assessing approval for the president. These bias parameters are not only necessary parts of any realistic model of approval that utilizes data from multiple polling organizations, but easily estimaetd via the Bayesian dynamics linear model. Tests of structural break and/or
regime switching are also easily accommodated in the Bayesian framework.","Neal Beck and Howard Rosenthal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-03-03","Accepted","","Yes","2006-03-28","2006-03-28","","","","","0000-00-00","hotel/other","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","200","",""

A prominent change in a political agency relationship, at least in formal terms, occurred when the 17th Amendment to the Constitution established direct election of U.S. Senators as of 1914. What effect did this institutional change have on the representation of states by their senators? We argue that prior to the 17th Amendment, the state population relied on an intermediary, the state legislature, to control its U.S. Senators. This intermediary was a sophisticated monitor of the behavior of senators, but itself not a perfect agent of the populace. After the 17th Amendment, the state populace gained more direct control over its U.S. Senators, but sacrificed expert monitoring of their behavior. If this view is correct, senators after the 17th Amendment should better reflect the ideology of their home states‚?? populace, but also exhibit greater variability relative to other members of their state‚??s delegation. We show that these expectations are borne out empirically. First, U.S. Senators from moderate states exhibit less extreme roll call behavior after the 17th Amendment; second, differences in roll call records for senators from the same state are greater after the 17th Amendment. Finally, we argue that the moderating influence of the 17th Amendment has made the Senate less polarized as a body than it would have been otherwise.","Sean Gailmard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-22","Accepted","","Yes","0000-00-00","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This letter is a recommendation for Jean-Fran√ßois Godbout, a graduate student in the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University, who would like to attend the Political Methodology Summer Meeting at UC-Davis in July 2006.  I have known Jean-Fran√ßois for over three years now, since my arrival at Northwestern in September 2002.  In that time, I have spent a good amount of time with him, inside and outside of class, and I now serve on his dissertation committee.  Thus, I believe I am in a good position to evaluate his quality and likelihood for future success.
I give Jean-Fran√ßois my highest possible recommendation.  I have found him to be energetic, hard-working, and genuinely intellectually curious.  In my first quarter at Northwestern, I got to know Jean-Fran√ßois well, as he served as one of my teaching assistants.  He and I spent countless hours talking about published works, contemporary theories, and potential research ideas.  I realized right away that Jean-Fran√ßois was a very mature student, one who wanted to become a serious academic.  Later that year, Jean-Fran√ßois took my graduate course on the U.S. Congress, and I found his ability to grasp theoretical ideas and tackle empirical puzzles to be first-rate.  I gave him a straight ‚??A‚?ù for the course, a grade only given to one other student.  That summer, Jean-Fran√ßois took his preliminary exam in American politics, which I helped write and subsequently grade.  His answers were top-notch, and I awarded him a ‚??high pass.‚?ù
On the whole, I would rank Jean-Fran√ßois to be the best graduate student with whom I have worked at Northwestern University.  I would also put him in the league with two of my students from Michigan State University, who have subsequently gone on to tenure-track positions at the University of Georgia (Jamie Carson) and SUNY-Buffalo (Charles Finocchiaro).  I believe Jean-Fran√ßois has the potential to be as good as or even better than those students.  He has already shown indications of that potential, having published several scholarly journal articles and having been nominated a pre-dissertational fellow in the Center for Business, Government, and Society, at the Kellogg School of Management here at Northwestern.  Moreover, Jean-Fran√ßois has the ambition required to carve out a successful academic career.

Jean-Fran√ßois defended his dissertation proposal, entitled ‚??The Impact of Declining Turnout Rates on Congressional Legislative Behavior,‚?ù in late 2004.  He is investigating the degree to which members of Congress alter their vote choices in anticipation of changing turnout levels in congressional elections.  In addition, he is examining how turnout, via mobilization, is used as a weapon by challengers to punish congressional incumbents who stray too far ideologically from their district‚??s preferences.  He recently finished the first essay in the dissertation, which examines the decision calculi of voters and non-voters in congressional election years using NES survey data along with a sophisticated methodological design (based on ‚??propensity scores‚?ù).  I believe this essay has a chance to be published in a top American political science journal, and I am encouraging Jean-Fran√ßois to submit it for publication consideration in the near future.  He is well on his way toward finishing a second essay, which is a game-theoretic (and empirical) analysis of congressional vote choice and electoral turnout.  This essay has the potential to make a huge splash as well.
In short, Jean-Fran√ßois‚?? dissertation is a uniquely novel theoretical inquiry, as very few scholars of American politics have attempted to merge the study of elite behavior in the U.S. Congress with mass behavior in U.S. elections.  I believe this dissertation has tremendous promise, and potentially will have a significant impact on the study of the U.S. Congress as well as the study of American Politics more generally.  I think Jean-Fran√ßois would benefit greatly from the attending the Political Methodology Summer Meeting.  Getting feedback on one of his dissertation essays from a methodologically sophisticated crowd will be invaluable for him.
To repeat, I give Jean-Fran√ßois my highest recommendation.  Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Majority party roll rates - the portion of the time a majority of the majority party votes against a bill that passes nonetheless - have emerged as a key indicators of party success.  Roll rates, however, only capture half of the theoretical story.  Roll rates are well devised to gauge negative agenda control success, the ability of the majority party to block unwanted legislation.  However, one prominent theory of legislative organization - Conditional Party Government (CPG) - is primarily equipped to explain changes in the positive agenda control capacity of the majority party.  That is, it suggests that as the majority party becomes more homogeneous, we should see an increase in the delegation of power to party leaders, with the intention that these party leaders will help facilitate that passage of policies that the newly cohesive majority can now agree upon.  This prediction presents the need for a measure of the success of these changes in delegation.  We propose a solution.  By methods similar to those used in deriving roll rates, we construct two measures of positive agenda control (and several variants of each).  The first - successes - is the number of times a majority of the majority support a bill that ultimately passes.   The second - disappointments - is the number of times that a majority of the majority support a bill that fails.  Using these measures, we test predictions from the CPG model for the period 1877-2000.

final winning alternative or bill. Thus, in order to test empirical validity of the spatial voting model, we need to estimate not just ideal points of legislators but also the locations of bills. However, estimating bill locations in multidimensional spaces has
been tricky. Although Clinton and Meirowitz's agenda constrained ideal point estimation is an improvement on this, the limitation of
this approach in a multidimensional setting is that it requires each bill to be related to only one dimension. The bills that are related to more than one dimension still cannot be estimated even after the agenda constraints. Here, I suggest that this problem can be solved if the legislature has an amendment procedure that allows votes on
perfecting amendments to have precedence over votes on substitutes. This is because a perfecting amendment tends to be short and
one-dimensional and because a substitute, which tends to be long and multidimensional, often has same components as the amendments that were voted on earlier. If this is the case, we can use this information to constrain the location of the substitute in one dimension to be same as that of the  earlier amendment. In this paper, I report results from my simulation analysis. Then, I apply this approach to the roll call data from the U.S. Senate, where the principle of ``precedence'' accommodates estimation of bill locations. By comparing the locations of winning bills and the uncovered set calculated from the estimated ideal points, I show how we can test the predictive power of the spatial voting model with roll call data. Since empirical tests of the spatial voting model have been limited to data from experiments, this is the first empirical test of the spatial voting theory with real world data.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-23","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-04","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

Only six months into the war, two additional states had joined on the side of Austria and five on the side of Serbia. By the time the war ended in November 1918, thirteen additional states had joined; three on the side of Austria-Hungary and ten on the side of Serbia. What began as a war between two states grew into what we now know as World War I, a war that alone is responsible for an astonishing 27% of the fatalities across all interstate wars between 1816 and 2001. Most interstate wars (80%) do not follow this pattern; they end without expanding to include states beyond the original belligerents. But those wars that do expand (20%) account for an exorbitant 88% of the fatalities across all interstate wars during this time period. 

This paper examines three interrelated puzzles: 1) Why do some wars expand while others do not? 2) How does war expansion alter the dynamics of war? 3) How does the participation by third parties influence the likelihood of participation by other third parties? I investigate these puzzles using a combination of formal and empirical techniques. I begin by employing agent-based modeling to run computer-based simulation experiments, from which I derive propositions based on the emergent behavioral patterns of third parties during an ongoing war and on the effects of third party intervention on the dynamics of war. I then subject the propositions derived from these computer experiments to empirical evaluation using statistical analysis.

To model war expansion I created an artificial international system populated by agents (i.e., states) who interact in an anarchic environment. The agents are heterogeneous in their power (i.e., military capability) and the utility they derive from each of the initial participants winning the war (i.e., affinity). Following the onset of a war between two of these agents, each agent not involved in the war (i.e., third party) decides whether or not to participate. Each third party‚??s decision is a mathematically prescribed function of that state‚??s expected utility, calculated as a product of its power and its affinity for the initial participants. The decision of whether or not to join is endogenous to the dynamics of the war; as the war persists, each agent re-evaluates its decision to participate and adapts its behavior to the current conditions of the war (i.e., who now is winning the war and which other third parties now are participating) and decides anew whether or not to participate. This artificial world is analogous to a laboratory in which I ‚??grow‚?ù war expansion to examine how the micro-level behavior of many locally-interacting agents generates the emergent behavioral patterns of war expansion. These patterns serve as theoretical predictions that we should see emerge in the real world under parallel conditions. 

After conducting experiments in this artificial world (in the form of computer simulations; n.b., these simulations are already completed) under varying initial conditions, I derive hypotheses based on the emergent behavioral patterns. The first hypothesis predicts the effect of third party participation on the probability of a war ending at a specific point. The second hypothesis relates the timing of third party participation and the side on which that participation occurs. Both of these hypotheses are evaluated using competing risks hazard model on a sample of 79 interstate wars between 1816-2001 complied by the Correlates of War project. The combination of formal and statistical methods will provide additional insight into why wars expand than either method used in isolation and thus provides an improvement on previous studies of war expansion.

Using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) data, my dissertation research investigates how electoral rules affect the poor in a broadly comparative analysis.  The proposed research will contribute to this larger project, and concentrates on the methodological challenges of analyzing cross-national income survey data:  How can poverty be measured in a cross-national context?  How can the effects of redistributive policy be observed? While the LIS data offer an important opportunity to evaluate these questions, there are additional challenges that arise in their use. Countries are observed at different points in time, for example, and with varying frequency. The proposed research will address these issues, and present an analysis of LIS data that investigates the validity of empirical propositions derived in a formal theoretic model of electoral  competition.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-03-01","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-05","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

Randomization and committee seniority in the U.S. House of Representatives","This project examines the effects of committee seniority rankings on legislative careers in the House of Representatives. While formal models suggest that seniority systems represent an inter-generational equilibrium, rewarding senior members to provide incentives for junior members, there is relatively little evidence about the value of the seniority system to legislators themselves.  In the legislative context, one might expect that members ranked higher on a committee would have a higher probability of re-election, or that lower-ranked members would be more likely to transfer to other committees.  Obtaining estimates of such effects can be problematic, however, since many legislator characteristics (age, experience, etc.) co-vary with committee seniority.  We take advantage of the committee assignment process used by the House Democrats in order to obtain unbiased estimates of these effects.  After committee assignments are made, lots are drawn to establish rankings when two or more new committee members have equal chamber seniority.  This randomization ensures that, within these groups of committee members, the committee ranks are uncorrelated in expectation with background characteristics that could introduce bias.  In general, we focus on the effects of a one-rank difference in committee seniority on various career outcomes.  We use both permutation and Bayesian model-based approaches as appropriate to make valid inferences about the consequences of this aspect of the congressional seniority system.

advanced methods class, in her first year in graduate school.  She was
active and engaged, often tutoring other students in the class.  In
fact, she got to know the statistical models and R (the statistical
package we used) so well, her nickname in class was R-help!  She came
to us with good economics background and has been picking up methods
very quickly.  She has the aptitude, interest, and skills, and she
writes very well; I would strongly encourage you to support her.

Olivia is a coauthor with Kosuke Imai (a former student now on the
faculty at Princeton) and me on new statistical software, called Zelig
(see \url{http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig}), and is the coauthor on
several academic papers now in preparation related to this
development.  The software is intended to be a fairly complete (open
source and free) statistical package, covering most major types of
statistical inference.  However, the software is merely the
implementation of the intellectual development, which is a simple
unified notation and syntax for users that can encompass a large
fraction of existing statistical procedures, all without requiring any
changes in existing approaches.  We conjecture that this idea can be
used to encompass and present simply essentially all major statistical
methods, regardless of the theory of inference on which they are
based, notation with which they were developed, and programming syntax
with which they have been implemented.

Olivia has been involved in every stage of design, execution, and
documention of this program, and as a result has gained a deep and
extremely broad understanding of a wide range of statistical methods.
Throughout, she has been an equal collaborator.  The bulk of the first
version of this program was written in her second year in graduate
school, while she was taking a full load of demanding courses and
preparing for general exams.  Olivia made major contributions to the
intellectual contribution of this work, as well as the design and
programming of the software, and she took the lead in writing a nearly
300 page combination book and manual that documents the statistical
methods.

Now that Olivia is finishing her classwork, she has begun her thesis
work.  Her plan is to apply her formidable technical skills to the
relationship between (economic and political) development and public
health.  Her take is to demonstrate statistically the direct effect on
output and indirect effect on social organization and capacity of the
effects of major public health interventions on economic and political
development.  She has access to a unique survey of many countries with
better measures of political and health variables than has been
possible previously.  In my view, this is likely to be a important
study that will have a major impact on the literature.

Olivia has a bright future and it is easy to forecast that she will
take her place upon graduation among the best in her field.  Please
let me know if I can provide any additional information.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-17","","","Yes","0000-00-00","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

research assistant, and as a collaborator.

Dan is a highly promising student of state and local politics. He came to us after a
very successful undergraduate experience, during which he wrote a senior thesis on
the Spanish Civil War. He has also had considerable practical experience directly
observing politics and politicians both in New York City, and on Captial Hill.

Although his previous academic work was mostly historical, he has turned to im-
proving his skill set by signing up for a diffcult series of mathematics and statistics
courses. He has been doing exceptionally well, and has a bright future. As a second
year graduate student, Dan was already coauthoring scholarly papers with faculty,
most recently with Beth Simmons on a paper that has now appeared in the APSR.

Dan has also been working closely with me this past semester on a variety of substan-
tive and methodological projects; as one example of his training, during this time, he
single-handedly programmed a fairly elaborate generalization of ordinal probit. We
are also working on a way, through natural language processing, of extracting po-
litical information from the millions of Americans who are expressing their political
opinions in blogs on the web.

Dan‚??s thesis, to which this project would contribute, now looks like it will be com-
posed of the key argument that what affects racism, social capital, and other com-
munity effects is not levels of ethnic diversity, but the distruption caused by abrupt
changes in ethnic diversity. His result seem to indicate that people can adjust to
many situations, the key variable not being the situation but the adjustment. If he
is able to demonstrate this, as seems likely, this will be a major project of substantial
political science and policy importance.

I strongly endorse Dan‚??s proposal. Please let me know if I can provide any additional 
information.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-19","","","Yes","0000-00-00","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

policy and political methodology.  He took my advanced methods class
in his first year in graduate school and wrote a paper that seems sure
to be published.  Ryan has now taken 10 methods classes in three
departments and will also receive an MA in statistics, in addition to
his Ph.D.\ in political science.  The widespread, and accurate, view
of those who know him is that he is serious, smart, and almost sure to
make it at a very high level in the profession.

Ryan also worked with me to see the effect of new methods of mortality
forecasting we've developed on forecasts of the future of the social
security system.  As it turns out, all the work that has gone into
forecasting the future of social security has been conditional on a
single and highly simplistic method of forecasting (it doesn't even
use covariates).  I suspect that this work will have major policy
implications, but either way Ryan has demonstrated his impressive
abilities.

He's also worked closely with me in a major evaluation of the new
Mexican health care system.  We randomized health care to communities
in Mexico and Ryan was deeply involved in matching communities and in
the randomization.  He's now involved in doing the analysis of the
first wave survey that came from this project.

When Ryan graduates he will likely be one of the most sophisticated
political methodologists in his cohort.  I would strongly encourage
you to support his application and to call if I can provide any
further information.

In an experimental research design, units are randomly selected from a population and randomly assigned to treatment.  By calculating the difference between the treated and control groups, researchers can evaluate the effect of the treatment, on average.  Although there are different ways of calculating the ATE (see, e.g., Imbens (2004)), the inferential goals of these techniques remain the same.  If unit selection is not random, but treatment assignment is, researcher can still perform inference on the causal effect of treatment conditional on the sub-population.  If neither unit selection or treatment assignment are random, then inferences at the causal or population level are subject to potential bias.  In this last case, we can achieve a quasi-experimental design, however, by matching treated and control units on the basis of pre-treatment covariates, and then estimating an average treatment effect.  
	In the context of public health, this poster will employ the compound hierarchical ordered probit model (e.g., in Wand, King, and Lau 2006) to estimate a multinomial propensity score for the quality of health institutions from WHO survey data from 69 countries (the data employ vignettes to establish the cross-cultural comparability of survey responses).  Matching on the quality of health institutions, this poster will estimate the causal effect of exogenous international health spending on domestic economic growth.

A model for final spending outcomes ought to reflect the overlapping representation of the House and Senate by describing district spending as the result of multiple legislators working on behalf of the district.  I propose a flexible statistical model for legislator shares within each chamber that allows direct comparison with share predictions from formal modeling approaches to bicameral bargaining.  This model allows disaggregation of House and Senate influence on appropriations and statistical estimation of the relative power of the two chambers using variation in funding by state size for either state- or district-level spending data.  Where district level data is available, it also allows estimation of the advantages that accrue from holding certain positions in the structure of the legislature, providing a platform for empirical tests of recently developed formal models of agenda-setting, veto, and committee powers.  I consider formula and earmark spending in the recently passed 2005 transportation legislation as a test of the model and find that the model accurately predicts the shape of the dependence of spending on state size for both formula and earmark spending, but that proposal power is distributed differently for those two types of appropriations.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-27","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-04","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

As such, we should relax the practice of estimating a single coefficient to judge the speed of error correction and allow the parameter to vary over time. The introduction of GARCH dynamic conditional correlation models (DCC, Engle 2002) provides political scientists with a new method of studying time varying parameters and this paper brings these two methodologies ‚?? error correction and the DCC model ‚?? together to demonstrate dynamic error correction. Data on the level of party unity in the two houses of Congress from 1789 to 2000 are used to demonstrate the method. It is found that while in both houses the level of party unity of the two parties are closely related and cointegrated, the speed of error correction varies enormously over time. That is, there is great variation in the tendency of parties to strategically vary their own level of party influence to counteract changes in the opposition‚??s level of unity.","Gregory Koger","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-23","Accepted","","Yes","2006-05-01","2006-05-01","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","200","",""

Their empirical findings are mixed and even contradictory. My study focuses on how different measures of ‚??legislative efficiency‚?ù and statistical methods lead to different conclusions about the relationship between government type and legislative efficiency. Mayhew (1991) measures legislative efficiency as ‚??legislative production,‚?ù which is the number of important bills passed. Based on this measure, Mayhew (1991) concludes that divided government is not associated with legislative efficiency. However, my study challenges Mayhew‚??s findings since efficiency should also be based on input. Additionally, Mayhew used an inappropriate statistical method (OLS) to evaluate count data. In contrast, my study measures legislative efficiency as ‚??legislative productivity,‚?ù which is the proportion of important bills passed from all that are considered. The study tests how government type affects legislative production and productivity using appropriate MLE methods. First, since legislative production as measured by Mayhew used counts of important bills passed, I employed Poisson/Negative Binomial regression to replicate his analysis. Second, I evaluate legislative productivity using my improved measure using Beta regression because legislative productivity is measured as the proportion of important bills passed from all that are considered. The Beta regression results show that divided government strongly affects legislative productivity.

Many scholars of identity who use quantitative methodology employ simple, one-dimensional measures such as census categories.  However, national identity is a complex theoretical construct that is best treated as a multi-dimensional variable.  Thus, I employ structural equation modeling to measure the multiple facets of subjects' national identities in Bosnia & Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia.  The data used in this paper derive from an original survey I administered in May 2004 and May 2005 to the students and history teachers of 21 secondary schools in 12 towns in BiH (N=2,989) and Croatia (N=1,468).  This paper uses multiple measures for the strength of students' identification with both their ethnic group and the state.  My analyses proceed in three stages.  I begin by examining the opposition of state identity and ethnic group identity, and then turn to separate analyses of students' identification with each of these entities.  This paper will be a chapter in my dissertation, which examines the broad questions of how individuals conceive of their national identities and how national identity is learned.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-28","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-05","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","Yes","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","I have not yet decided if I will be travelling with my son, who will be 21 months at the time of the meeting.","","",""

This study is motivated by the question: What is holding them back? Democratic theorists emphasize the importance of electoral accountability as the key mechanism for effective governance. I argue that ideological constraint, as set forth by Converse (1964), is a precondition for electoral accountability. Democracy works because exposure to democratic institutions increases opinion constraint. A lack of constraint reveals individuals' opinions to be largely random, which inhibits accountability. To the extent that constraint is slow to develop in new democratic regimes, the quality of governance will suffer. 

Testing this hypothesis requires a measure of ideological constraint that is appropriate and reliable for cross-national research. I develop just such a measure, based upon the statistical technique of latent class analysis, that is superior to existing bivariate correlational measures. Applying this methodology to data from a range of cross-national academic global opinion surveys, I measure the constraint of political ideologies in a diverse sample of new democracies as compared to established democracies. This reveals the extent to which new and established democracies actually differ in terms of their ideological context. I then demonstrate empirically that constraint varies in expected ways with exposure to democratic rule. 

The latent class model models the distribution of survey responses as a mixture of latent cross-classification tables across discrete ideological ""types"" of survey respondent. The model clusters respondents and estimates the class-conditional response probabilities to each question. It further estimates the effect of concomitant variables in predicting latent class membership. To estimate the latent class model, I employ a new R package I have developed with Jeff Lewis that, for the first time, enables R users to estimate latent class models with both polytomous outcome variables and covariates. For each surveyed country, estimates of respondents‚?? class membership and probability of giving each survey response are then used to measure levels of constraint both within and across class.

My research into ideological constraint bridges a gap between survey-based behavioral studies of ideology and studies of issue ""dimensionality"" primarily using dichotomous dependent variables. It is also unique in its cross-national approach to the study of ideological constraint. Which cleavages--as well as how many--actually shape political conflict in new democracies, remains an open question. But it is answerable with the proper statistical analysis of existing cross-national public opinion data.

Compare to the exisitng methods for ideal points estimation, we relax two main assumptions, independence among legislators and that individuals response to bills independently given their ideal points. Then we propose to model such dependence via random effects. This allows us to analyze the complex structures that often arise in the analysis of legislative behaviors using roll call or Supremem Court vote data.

The main idea was motivated by the treatment of 'testlets' in education testing. A teslet refers to a cluster of testing items to which examinees may not answer independently even given their 
ability. For example, a testlet can be questions based on the same paragraph in reading comprehensive tests. In Wang's previous work (with Bradlow, Wainer, 1999), a random effect $\gamma_{id(j)}$ is proposed to model the person-specific testlet effect. In this paper, we further introduce a group-specfic testlet effect
$\phi_{p(i)d(j)$, where $p(i)$ is the group membership of the respondents, $d(j)$ indicates the 'testlet' membership of the
items. The latent score function can then be written as
 t_{ij} = a_j(\theta_i-b_j-\gamma_{id(j)}-\phi_{p(i)d(j)})+\epsilon_{ij}, $\theta_i$ being the ideal point, $a_j$ and $b_j$
being the item parameters. Below we illustrate how important issues such as multimdimensionality, time varing patterns and party effect in ideal point estimation can be easily approached in this model.

Multidimensionality: Different issue areas often are correlated with different ideological dimensions. Given the primary
dimension of ideal point, individual's responses to some bills/cases can be correlated through the rest unmanifested
dimensions of his/her ideology. A good proxy to model and test such correlation is through the person-specific testlet effect
$\gamma_{id{j}}$ that are defined based on the issue area of the bills/cases. 

Time-varying ideal points: Similarly, the testlet can be defined according to time period. Given the baseline ideal point, we can measure a person-specific effect in each time period and test the significance of such effects. 

Party effect: By grouping respondents by their party membership ($p(i)$) and further constructing testlet$(d(j)$) according to
certain substantive interests, we can examine, for example, the party effect on the voting process of certain bills, and the pattern of party influence in different Houses.

Morover, this model can incorporate covariates to explore any systematic components that account for the variation in ideal points, the correlated legislative behaviros, the formation of the party effects, and other questions of interest to theorists in legislative politics. 

Some empirical studies have been conducted using the Congressional Historical Statistics and Wang's free software
(SCORIGHT) that models the person-specific testlet effects. Ongoing work includes fitting the group-sepcific testlet effects
and model selection and diagnostics.

I strongly recommend without reservation that Jong Hee Park be selected
to attend the 2006 methods meeting at Davis.  Simply put, Jong Hee is
the strongest methods student to come out of Wash U since the late
1990s.  Jong Hee is currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student.  He came to
Wash U after completing an M.A. at Seoul National University and some
graduate-level coursework at Claremont Graduate School.  During his time
here Jong Hee has completed the three semester methods sequence in the
department, as well as an advanced course on Bayesian methods I teach. 
He has also taken two semesters of coursework with Sid Chib in the OIin
School of Business, a stochastic processes course in the engineering
school (just for fun), and all of the advanced econometrics classes in
the economics department.  Jong Hee is technically very gifted and has
been working closely with me for three years.  In addition to working as
a research and teaching assistant, Jong Hee has been involved in the
MCMCpack project, and is the lead author of the Bayesian Task View on
CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).

Jong Hee is making good progress on his dissertation project and will be
on the methods market this fall.  Jong Hee's substantive field is
international political economy.  His dissertation applies modern
Bayesian tools to a number of IPE questions, including those surrounding
agricultural subsidies, electoral systems, distributive politics, and
theories of international conflict.  The poster he has proposed surveys
time-varying parameter time series models (with both continuous and
discrete outcome variables).  He offers a criticism of the literature's
assumption of constant structural parameters, offers an alternative,
develops MCMC algorithms to fit the models, and provides software.  This
poster will be of interest to many at the meeting, and it will provide
Jong Hee the opportunity to receive valuable substantive and technical
feedback on his work.

I hope that you can accommodate Jong Hee's application.  Please do not
hesitate to contact me if you require additional information.  I also
want the committee to know that I will cover all of Jong Hee's expenses
to attend the meeting so he will not draw on any section or NSF funds.

Yours truly,

vote totals reported in the election?  Being able to test for
corruption using such limited information is important if we wish to
implement fully automated, routine vetting of election returns.  Such
tests should not depend on any substantive assumptions peculiar to the
particular election at hand.  For example, ideas about party
loyalties, ideological commitments or the contents of the given
campaigns should play no role.  Not using such assumptions may help
obviate controversies about whether the substantive model is correct,
controversies that not only may delay reaching a conclusion about the
status of the current election but also may distract attention from
the core issue of whether the vote tallies are valid.

Benford's Law may serve as the foundation for such tests.  I show that
a kind of mixture process that generally occurs in elections produces
vote counts that have second digits that satisfy Benford's Law, at
least when the counts are for totals at the level of precincts.
Benford's Law may also hold for higher levels of aggregation, but the
usefulness of examining higher levels is questionable when the goal is
to detect vote fraud.  At lower levels of aggregation, in particular
for machine-level vote totals, I show that Benford's Law may not hold
if multiple voting machines are used at each polling place and voters
are randomly assigned to voting machines.  The random assignment of
voters to machines may eliminate a key feature of clustering among
voters that is important for producing digits that satisfy Benford's
Law.  If machine-level totals and other important information about
how the voting machines were used are available, a randomization test
can be used to check for distortions in the vote counts.  I use
simulation exercises to assess how sensitive the tests are to various
kinds of corruption, and I apply the tests to various collections of
data from recent elections.

Addressing the party nature of modern representative democracies in Europe I assess whether policy preferences of political parties (in and outside a government) become realised in structural composition of budgetary spending. Much existing work in the field maps policy positions of political actors based on the preferences expressed in the electoral arena of political competition (election manifestos and expert surveys). Information contained in legislative arena of political competition, which is vital to the functioning of democracy in general and budgetary process in particular, is thus excluded from the analyses. At the same time, budgetary politics is predominantly analysed based on preferences expressed in the legislative arena by the voting behaviour of legislators (roll-call vote analysis). In order to integrate two strands of research and address inherently multidimensional nature of budgetary process I estimate a hierarchical Bayesian model. Pre-election policy positions are derived from the pledges made by political actors in electoral arena as stated in the election manifestos, while post-election policy positions are derived from the legislative arena utilising data on legislative voting behaviour in West European parliamentary democracies.

These models fit a line to each respondents's observations across panel waves and handle cross-sectional predictors better than autoregressive models. In this paper, I argue that Bayesian hierarchical models allow researchers to estimate the stability of a variable in an LGM.  More pervasive approaches to LGMs include confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical linear modeling, both of which allow the researcher to model the systematic variance in linear latent trajectories. However, researchers interested in the predictability of an individual's trajectory would need to use a two-step estimation procedure with these approaches. First, the latent trajectory's slope and intercept need to be extracted from factor scores or Empirical Bayes estimates of the coefficients. Second, the researcher could model the slope and intercept with a multivariate normal distribution that includes a heteroscedastic variance model, and these variance model coefficients would speak to predictability. Bayesian hierarchical models, on the other hand, are more accommodating to variance models and therefore allow a one-step estimation procedure. I demonstrate the use of this model by showing that attitudes on social welfare are less predictable, and hence unstable, among attitudinally ambivalent individuals.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-24","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-06","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

We enhance these analyses through the use of new data developed from a novel large-scale analysis of Congressional floor speech. We note in particular that legislative speech ‚?? containing verbal dissent and counterproposals ‚?? is the main tool at the disposal of minority parties who wish to bring issues to the forefront of debate.  Floor speech also allows a more continuous monitoring of legislative attention as a whole than does the record of Congressional hearings.  With a time series at a daily, rather than annual, level, a richer set of agenda dynamics can be explored.

The sheer volume of the legislative record has limited its use for such purposes.  Manual coding of the entire Congressional Record is simply too expensive.  We introduce a new (Bayesian) model, dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA), which extends the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003) into a time series context.  We also introduce a new linguistic data set (corpus) built from all debate contributions in the Congressional Record from 1989-2004.  Individual observations consist of the frequency counts of word stems (Porter 2002) within each speech. With DLDA, we estimate the dynamic probability that each debate contribution belongs to one of K topics.  Discrimination parameters for word stems allow us to give substantive labels to each topic, corresponding to policy categories (health, trade) or others specific to the particular chamber (judicial nominations, legislative calendar).  In turn, we can produce a daily estimate of the rhetorical attention given to each policy area in each chamber, which can be directly crosswalked with and compared to the annual and monthly data that emerges from the Policy Agendas Project.

This project builds on our prior work on rhetorical ideal-point models (Monroe and Maeda 2004) and is funded by National Science Foundation Grant # BCS-0527513 (Monroe, Abney, Colaresi, Quinn, and Radev 2005).

Mike is a fourth year PhD student at MSU with an MA from Georgia and BA from Rochester.  He will defend his dissertation this summer and be a Congressional Fellow next year, when he will be on the academic market.

He has already compiled most of his tenure record. By my last count, he had six major publications out or forthcoming ‚?? two in PA (one single-authored), and one each in AJPS, APR, SPPQ, and LSQ ‚?? and several more in progress.

I presume graduate students with single-authored pieces in PA meet the bar, but if I must go on ‚?¶ His methodological training includes our four-semester sequence, the Economics Department‚??s three-semester sequence (with Jeff Wooldridge and Peter Schmidt), the Geography Department‚??s GIS course, and two summers at ICPSR (including MLE 1 with Charles Franklin, MLE 2 with Chris Zorn et al., and Bayes with Jeff Gill). He passed his methods comp with distinction.

This project includes the input of federal and state officials, the creation of matched pairs of geographic health care units, the definition of several levels of analytic interest, and the estimation of causal effects at these levels.  At the health unit level, this project combines completely randomized assignment with continuously-measureable compliance effort.  At the individual level, it features an encouragement design (Hirano, et al. 2000) and a further statistical complication: the implementation of treatments in small areas forces researchers to confront the usual assumption of unit non-interference.  Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimates of causal effects draw on unique data produced in the first wave of a 35,000 household survey completed in seven Mexican states in fall 2005.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-03-01","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-12","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

","919.593.1952","919.962.0432","evanps@email.unc.edu","Poster Proposal","A Motivation-Context Model of Political Learning","This study examines political-information dynamics in the American mass public.  Its central premise is that citizens regularly pick up on information about changing political conditions and use it to revise or ``update'' their perceptions of these conditions.  Because this process requires the merger of prior beliefs and new information, I model perception updating using the Bayesian learning framework.  The central thrust of the model involves individuals' evaluations of information-signal credibility.  And, to a great extent, these ``credibility calculations'' are generated by the relative balance of two motivational goals: the desire to reach accurate conclusions on the one hand, and to preserve prior beliefs on the other.  The nature of particular informational contexts also plays a part.

Empirical tests of the motivation-context model find differential learning patterns across issues. In large measure, this heterogeneity can be explained by variation in the costs associated with perceptual inaccuracy---termed the ``stakes of misperception.'' On issues where these stakes are relatively high---for example, on evaluations of the economy's standing---people's perceptions display marked responsiveness to changing conditions. Yet, where these stakes are relatively low---consider assessments of political parties' policy promises---people appear to be more resistant to information. Crucially, findings for heterogeneous learning patterns help to explain why scholars have arrived at contradictory conclusions about the quality of mass political learning (e.g., Gerber & Green 1998, 1999; Bartels 2002).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-28","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-05","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

Mark Ramirez has asked me to recommend him for the summer Methods meeting and I do so enthusiastically.  Mark is, without a doubt, the best graduates student A&M has ever had.  While I have only been here six years, I know I can say this because it is the consensus view of the faculty I have talked about it with here.  He is as smart as they come, unbelievably hard working, has shown real aptitude at methods, and asks important theoretically motivated questions.  He is also a great guy.  He is one of those graduate students that you really enjoy having around and will miss when he leaves.
Mark showed up at A&M completely prepared for graduate school.  He had taken graduate seminar from Paul Goren and Kim Fridkin while an undergraduate at Arizona State.  I was struck during his visit here by how intellectually mature and creative he was.  During out chat while he was here he pitched a paper idea to me for an original experiment testing theories of distributive justice and support for political institutions.  After he arrived, I helped him through the institutional review process to get the study approved and double checked some of his question wording, but Mark took the complete responsibility for this paper.  The experiment turned out beautifully and is now under review at JOP.  He is also part of two other projects with me and has other faculty lining up to work with him.  I expect that Mark will have several publications in top journals to his name when he goes on the market.
His performance in seminars has been unparalleled.  He not only reads all of the required and recommended readings for a week, he often reads other work cited in those readings to make sure he fully understands all of the literature.  He is engaged in class, asking the best questions and pushing his fellow students to move beyond petty details and think theoretically.  His writing was good when he arrived.  He has taken gain effort to improve it, asking as many faculty members to read his work as possible.  
His methods skills are also probably the best I have seen here.  Part of this is that Mark gets it.  He knows the importance of sound methods and has taken every class possible on the topic including two classes in regression (taught using Gujarati and Greene), an experimental methods course, time series, maximum likelihood, and game theory.  He will also be attending ICPSR this summer to take Jeff Gill‚??s Bayesian modeling class and Bill Jacoby multi-dimensional scaling.  He has received A‚??s in every class and from what I have heard has had the top score in every course as well.  
A&M has sent several students to the methods meeting in recent years.  In my mind Mark is head and shoulders above all of the ones we have sent.  He is precisely the type of student that will be well served by the Methods meeting.  If you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to contact my at dave@polisci.tamu.edu or 979-845-6783.

This is of particular importance to the key democratic principle of electoral accountability that parties in power should and are held accountable for the outcomes of their actions and policies through the electoral process. It would be very problematic for democracy as we understand it, if it were found that this is not the case. Given the evidence from many nations that the economy is an issue of importance to the electorate, which they believe the government has control over, the inconsistent findings with regards to the impact of the economy on party popularity has been a real challenge to the principle of electoral accountability. I demonstrate that this puzzle is largely a product of methodological flaws in the development of popularity functions. Popularity functions use public opinion time-series data - either government or party support over time. The statistical tools utilised to examine the dynamics of government and party support have been problematic and, at times, inappropriate. Most analysts using such data have not applied the necessary methods to take into account the problems which such public opinion time-series processes can pose - problems such as complex error structures, shifting and compound non-stationary dynamics and noisy data. I examine the many potential difficulties of working with aggregate, public opinion time-series data and present a state-space Bayesian approach which alleviates many of these challenges providing a framework for examining the impact of macro-economic conditions on public opinion.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-21","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-04","2006-04-04","","","","","0000-00-00","hotel/other","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","200","",""

Now, technology from computational linguistics and semantic analysis is facilitating lower cost solutions.  Wordscores, by Benoit, Laver, and Garry (2003), is an example of one such technique.  Computational linguists use other techniques generally based on support vector machines, neural networks, nearest neighbor classification, Bayesian probability, decision trees, inductive rule learning, and regression models.

When selecting an algorithm for a task, the computational linguistic profession focuses on a few metrics, such as prediction, recall, and inter-coder reliability statistics like Cohen's Kappa and AC1.  But since coding schemes frequently measure multiple independent concepts of interest, these statistics are insufficient to judge whether an algorithm is suitable for a task.  This poster examines the use of a sensitivity analysis method to isolate an algorithm‚??s performance against a single concept of interest.  Such a method would be useful to a political scientist interested in justifying the selection of a specific algorithm for the study of (as an example) welfare and social issue attention within political party platforms.

In an example, I examine a method which illuminates the issues being captured and separated well by a suite of algorithms under analysis.  I take some party platforms which have been scored by expert humans, such as those developed by the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP).  Next I calculate the predictive performance of a handful of regression algorithms applied to issue attention in the party platforms.  Finally, I conduct a sensitivity analysis of the algorithms by deleting sentences (the concepts or units under analysis) from the original platforms and then re-running the automated analysis techniques against the truncated platforms.  The selection of sentences for deletion is random in a control study but based on the codes assigned by expert human annotation in the second pass.  The result is a comparison of the predictive performance of the algorithms with specific classes of issues removed from the text.

For discussion, I then propose that a method such as this should be a standard sensitivity analysis technique for evaluating the performance of computational algorithms against human annotated content analysis of political text when the unit of analysis in the human annotated work is considered independent.

Public opinion scholars have usually paid little attention to the policymaking delegated to administrative agencies (e.g., Page and Shapiro 1992, Erikson, MacKuen and Stimson 2003). At the same time, public administration scholars have focused almost exclusively on the role of political elites, such as elected politicians and interest groups, and have rarely included the preferences of the general public in their analyses (e.g., Weingast and Moran 1983; Moe 1984; McCubbins, Noll, Weingast 1987). 
This research develops a theoretical framework that explains how legislative oversight ‚?? the main mechanism connecting legislative and executive institutions ‚?? affects both administrative policy-making and, consequently, administrative responsiveness to public opinion. The game-theoretical model suggests that, contrary to conventional wisdom, once congressional oversight mechanisms are taken into account, administrative responsiveness and legislative responsiveness do not always appear in tandem. For example, when the government is divided ‚?? i.e. when the respective preferences of the executive and legislative branches are on opposite sides of the political spectrum ‚?? a shift of legislative preferences toward the preferences of the general public will result in less congruence between the public‚??s preferences and the actual policies enacted by the administrative agencies. 
My empirical analysis focuses on policy-making by federal regulatory agencies. My theoretical predictions are tested using data on enforcement policy decisions made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. I build a time-series dataset that includes measures of agencies‚?? performances, such as enforcement activities, official inspections, notices and citations, and criminal charges filed by the agencies against regulation violators from 1960 till 2004. Using these data, I estimate the impact of the public‚??s general ideology and specific regulatory policy preferences on the performance measures of the two commissions while controlling for agencies‚?? preferences and the mechanisms of congressional oversight.
Since my theoretical model predicts that institutional constraints, such as the threat of congressional intervention, induce agencies to enact policies that are different from the policies they would have enacted in the absence of institutional constraints, I need to devise a method for obtaining measurements of ideological preferences that are independent of actual policy-making.  I use two different methods of estimating commissioners‚?? preferences. First, I use each commission member‚??s partisan affiliation as a proxy for his/her ideological preferences in a given year. In addition, I take advantage of the fact that each commissioner‚??s nomination has to be confirmed by the Senate. The confirmation votes‚?? cutpoints are used as proxies for the locations of the commissioners‚?? respective ideal points. The main advantage of using this method is the ability to measure both legislative and administrative preferences by using the same scale. Furthermore, unlike models that use the nominating president‚??s ideal points to measure an agency‚??s preferences (e.g., Shipan 2004), this new measure allows for variations in the preferences of commissioners nominated by the same president.

Public opinion scholars, however, have found congressional approval decreases as legislative productivity increases partly due to increases in congressional conflict. What can explain the tides of congressional approval across time? Do increases or decreases in legislative productivity coincide with decreases in congressional approval? This paper argues inconsistencies in previous findings are the result of measurement error. New measurement strategies of both legislative productivity and procedural conflict lead to a more accurate depiction of the relationship between public opinion and congressional approval. A distributed lag time series regression model is used to estimate congressional approval quarterly from 1974 to 2004. The results have important implications for both the study of Congress and public opinion.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-22","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-04","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

together nicely.

Pat has proposed a methodologically and substantively innovative

All four are methods students at Rochester.  They have each completed the four courses in our methods sequence, which include linear models, MLE, Bayesian statistics, bootstrapping, and other topics.  Each is currently doing methods research, either individually or coauthored with me.  I believe all four attended the conference last year.  As I did last year (and the year before that), I would be happy to pay for the travel and lodging/meals for two of students.

In terms of ranking them, I would do so primarily by proximity to the job market:

1.  Taehee Whang.  Tahee's research is primarily on sanctions.  He is currently developing a formal model of sanctions, one that can be estimated using econometric methods.  Taehee and I are also coauthoring two papers on estimating econometric models of games with signaling.  In one, we show that Lewis & Schultz present a flawed comparison of their 2003 _Political Analysis_ signaling model to a model they attribute to me.  In the other paper, which I am submitting to present at this conference, Taehee Whang, Kyoungwon Seo, and I develop a stochastic game that generalizes both ""independent agent"" strategic models (e.g., QRE-like models) and traditional signaling models with Bayesian updating.  Our stochastic formulation allows for the models use in econometric estimation.

2.  Muhammet Bas.  Muhammet's research is in international conflict (formals models of offense-defense balance) and in methods.  Muhammet and I are involved in two coauthoring projects.  In the first, Muhammet, Robert Walker, and I develop an extremely simple iterative method for estimating strategic models. In the second, Muhammet, Kevin Clarke, and I differentiate forms of selection in international relations models and provide guidance to researchers concerning (1) when they need to worry about different forms of selection and (2) what they should do in those cases.

3.  David Carter.  David's research concerns the role of territory in interstate disputes.  He and I are currently coauthoring an article that re-examines the Beck, Katz, and Tucker approach for modeling time dependence in binary data models.  We show that their two main suggestions are problematic, although in different ways.  And, we provide a very simple method for modeling time dependence in logit and probit models.  I am also submitting this paper for presentation at this summer conference.

4.  Arthur Spirling.  Arthur is a methodologist and comparativist.  He currently has two coauthored projects with Kevin Quinn.  In fact, Kevin and he presented a paper at the methods conference last summer.  Arthur currently has two other papers that will soon be under review.  In the first, Arthur shows that many phenomena in political science are ""power law"" distributed.  In other words, nothing much usually happens, but when it does, it's big.  Arthur demonstrates this with applications to comparative, American politics, and IR.  In his second paper, Arthur develops and applies Bayesian limited dependent variable ""change-point"" models -- models were one can estimate temporal structural breaks simultaneously with the effects parameters for each time period. 

Each of these students (Bas, Carter, Spirling, and Whang) is and will be making contributions to political methodology.  I know the methods society does not have unlimited resources.  Therefore, as in recent years, I would be happy to split the costs, if it will allow each of these students to attend.  I know that they and the methods community would benefit from their attendance.  

Sincerely,
Curt Signorino

While we generally agree with BKT's assessment concerning the need to model temporal dependence in binary data, the proposed methods are not unproblematic.  Time dummies can be quite inefficient -- i.e., they waste degrees of freedom.  Moreover, they often result in perfect separation, which in turn necessitates that observations be dropped.  Cubic splines do not share these problems.  However, choosing the knots is often ad hoc.  Moreover, although they are easy to implement, splines are not easy to interpret.  Since splines are simply a smoothing approximation, we show that most researchers would be better served by using a third-order polynomial approximation:  t, t^2, and t^3.  Not only does this save degrees of freedom (in contrast to time dummies), but it is trivial to implement and to interpret (in contrast to cubic splines).  Using monte carlo analysis, we demonstrate that this polynomial approximation generally performs better than time dummies and as well as cubic splines.  Moreover, we illustrate these results by replicating and reanalyzing past research by Oneil & Russet, by Skocpol, and by Schultz.

However, there is still a disjuncture between theory and methods in this area.  Traditional game-theoretic models assume that each player completely knows at every point in the game how much she will value the outcomes in the model, no matter how far in the future those outcomes are.  In contrast, many recent stochastic games (e.g., QRE-like games) take an ""independent agent"" approach.  Here, each player is represented by a different agent at each information set.  A player's agents share the same average utility for outcomes, but have different private components that are unobserved by her fellow agents.  This assumption makes intuitive sense when moves are temporally distant -- e.g., I may not completely know how I'll value an outcome far in the future.  This assumption, however, implies that players do not learn from each other's moves, since the private information for each agent is unknown to and independent of that player's agents farther down the tree.  Players cannot learn from each other's moves and cannot signal each other by their moves.

In this paper, we develop a ""correlated agent"" model in which the traditional updating model and the independent agent model are special cases.  The idea is actually quite simple.  Players are represented by agents at each information set.  Each player's agents share the same average utility for outcomes, but have private components unobserved by the other agents.  Two aspects differentiate it from the independent agent model.  First, we assume a player's agents' private information is correlated (at rho) for a given outcome.  Second, players update according to Bayes rule.  

When rho=0, each agent's private information is unknown and independent of each other agent's and the model reduces to the independent agent model.  When rho=1, each agent (for a given player) knows exactly what each of her fellow agent's preferences are, and the model reduces to the traditional game-theoretic model.  The case of 0&lt;rho&lt;1 is interesting, because it implies that a player's preferences may change as play progresses, but the correlation provides information that allows that player to signal and for the other player to update.  

This model is fully stochastic -- i.e., it puts positive probability on all outcomes -- so it can be used in statistical analysis just as QRE-like models or like Lewis & Schultz's (2003) perfect bayesian model.  Indeed, Lewis & Schultz are making the data available for a recent paper of theirs.  We have a preliminary version of that dataset and plan to reanalyze the data, using this correlated agent model.  A major benefit of our model is that it simultaneously estimates rho, as well as the effects parameters.  Therefore, in addition to assessing the main substantive issues (e.g., concerning international conflict), we can determine the extent to which players completely know there future preferences vs being represented by independent agents.

Past works demonstrate candidates have the incentives and the abilities to influence the issue focus of voter evaluations (e.g. Johnston, Blais, Brady, and Crete 1992; Jacobs and Shapiro 1994).  However, when empirically evaluating such questions these works often fail to separate and control for the potentially endogenous influences of voters and the media. That is, candidate actions within campaigns are equally a reaction to voter and media behavior as vice-versa.  Consequently, the identification restrictions within structural equation techniques are inadequate and a modeling strategy that accounts for the possibilities of multiple endogenous relationships is preferred.


Importantly, new data resources, such as the National Annenberg Election Study and the Wisconsin Advertising Project, allow for a vector autoregression approach which partially avoids such problems (Freeman, Williams, and Lin 1989). This poster examines the adequacy of classical vector autoregression and error correction estimates when evaluating voter, media, and candidate issue agenda series across the 2000 campaign and whether different inferences are produced within a Bayesian time series approach which has recently been argued to produce more powerful and robust results (Brandt and Freeman 2006).  In particular, the stationary behavior of each series is evaluated to ascertain the accuracy of standard test distributions for each series (Sims, Stock, and Watson 1990; Freeman, Houser, Kellstedt and Williams 1998). Granger F-tests and impulse response functions are then presented to test the contrasting influences of candidate, media, and voter dynamics on each other.  Finally, beneficial post-estimation techniques, that are rarely used within political science, are implemented such as eigenvalue decomposition of the coefficient matrix (Hamilton 1994), residual autocorrelation (Johansen 1995), and residual normality tests (Jarque and Bera 1987) to ascertain the validity of vector autoregression estimates.


In general, the poster makes three important methodological contributions.  First, it provides an appropriate test of reciprocal influences within candidate, media, and voter behavior.  Second, it evaluates the stationary behavior of time series that are gaining use from new and popular data resources (e.g. Box-Steffensmeier, Darmofal, and Farrell 2005) and whether their dynamics produce different substantive inferences within a Bayesian VAR approach.  Finally, it demonstrates rarely used post-estimation tests that evaluate the validity of vector autoregression and error correction estimates.

Evan's project, a chapter from his dissertation, confronts the discrepancy between the political psychology of attitudes on the one hand and the macro tradition on the other.  The former holds -- from the theory of motivated reasoning -- that perceptions are strikingly biased by political passions. The latter finds perceptions strikingly accurate in the aggregate. Since bias aggregates up to systematic error (unlike the usual argument about random error cancelling in the aggregate), this combination of results seems impossible. The neat resolution in the paper is that bias in fact has no aggregate consequence, the reason being that longitudinal accuracy of perceptions arises out of accuracy motivations.  While individuals are strongly biased, that bias is constant over time and circumstances with the result that biased individuals nonetheless track reality (in this case economic performance), even though they are always wrong by that constant amount.

I strongly recommend Evan Parker-Stephen.

Among the measures of legislative ‚??power‚?ù considered in the literature are those that focus on legislative productivity‚??e.g., how many bills per session each legislator is able to push past the committee stage (and hence into serious contention for passage); or how many bills per session each is able to pass (cf. Frantzich 1979; Moore and Thomas 1991).  Most scholars who investigate legislative productivity seem to view it as analogous to ordinary economic productivity:  a member will be more productive if s/he can marshal more of the essential resources needed to ‚??produce‚?ù bills (i.e., to push them past key milestones in the legislative process).

Differences arise, however, regarding what those essential resources are.  As Frantzich (1979, 410) noted a generation ago, an individual legislator‚??s ‚??power‚?ù might increase with, among other things:  (1) majority status (e.g., Gross 1953; Cox and McCubbins 1993; Kim 2006); (2) congressional seniority (Dendiner 1964, 17; Davidson, Koveneck and O‚??Leary 1966, 98); (3) possession of important committee or floor leadership posts (Froman 1967, 35); and (4) ideological moderation (Black 1958; Krehbiel 1997).  

In this paper, we exploit a large new dataset documenting the legislative activity of all members of the US House from the 93rd to the 105th Congresses in order to revisit the determinants of legislative productivity in Congress.  We focus in particular on providing a better measure of the influence of majority status, by investigating how the productivity of individuals who switch from one party to another (and hence from majority to minority status, or vice versa) changes; and how the productivity of non-switching members changes when party control of the chamber changes.  Such research designs help to control for factors such as congressional seniority, committee membership and seniority, and ‚??fixed‚?ù characteristics of individuals.  We also employ ANOVA and random coefficients modeling techniques.

Despite the fact that Stephen is at Harvard this year (in the Kennedy School of Government), he is unusually talented and creative in the field of political methodology. You should not hold his Harvard background against him. 

Steve spent several years as a PM at a local software engineering firm in Redmond Washington dealing with a variety of issues related to databases, browsers, and security. As an undergraduate at UW he took two of my graduate methods classes. During this time he also worked as a consultant in the area of network security issues. He developed an interest in having the best tivo setup into an interest in realtime capture of political information, and with Hillard created a suite of programs that would record all the news presented on major outlets during the 2004 election. These recordings were parsed, in almost real time (okay over the period of about a day), and using some very creative uses of scaling decomposion scales of issues were created for both parties, by various markets. This work has been well received in computation linguistics. The techniques are quite different than the wordscores approach, and have been employed to ""code"" a variety of legislative agenda here at UW (where agendas are on the American politics agenda). 

Steve is an amazingly energetic guy, who has been creative in his application of his technical expertise and breadth of interests to the study of politics. While he is not really on the job market yet, he promises to be an interesting and valuable member of the Political Methodology community for years to come. I am sure he will bring an interesting poster (in fact I would push him for more than a poster, but an online demo as poster).

I hope you will have room for him at the UCDavis 2006 Summer Polmeth Conference.

Many scholars tend to explain this anomaly in terms of ‚??the symbolic use of sanctions‚?? separately from ‚??the instrumental use of sanctions‚??. The instrumental use of sanctions focuses on the extent to which the goals of the sender are accomplished as a result of sanctions. While the symbolic uses of sanctions are widely thought as alternative sources of initiating sanctions to the instrumental uses, scholars tend to use conceptually different kinds of symbolic sanctions. More importantly, little attention has been paid to their empirical evaluations. In this paper, I differentiate between two different symbolic effects of sanctions, one on international and the other on domestic audience. Then, I empirically test each symbolic impact of sanctions. First, for the international signaling impacts, I provide a fully structural model that employs a game theoretic model as a statistical model. The theoretical model formalizes a simple crisis bargaining logic with two-sided incomplete information. Not only does the empirical model take strategic interactions seriously, but also it allows me to estimate the amount of belief updating and signaling in sanctions‚?? episodes. Second, for the domestic political impacts, I examine the existence of audience benefits to the incumbent of sanctioning state, independent of the sanctions‚?? outcomes. I assess the effect of sanctions‚?? imposition on the US presidential approval from 1948 to 1993. Preliminary results suggest that sanctions often fail to work as a costly signal to represent the sender state's resolve and a target state does not learn much from observing sanctions. This cheapness of sanctions prevents signaling mechanism from determining the sanctions‚?? outcomes. Thus, one of the Fearon's rationalist accounts of war cannot be applied to economic sanctions. Sanctions rarely work as a credible indicator that reveals a priori unverifiable intension of the sender. On the other hand, I find that policymakers actually benefit by imposing sanctions in terms of increases in public support. Sanctions are an effective way of displaying ‚??do something‚?? leadership to the public in international conflicts. Consequently, the domestic audience benefits to the incumbent help us understanding the recurrence of sanctions despite their instrumental ineffectiveness.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-02-28","Accepted","","Yes","2006-04-05","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","dorm","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

This is a letter of recommendation for Han Soo Lee to attend the 2006 summer conference of the Society for Political Methodology at UC-Davis. As his dissertation advisor, I have advised Han Soo to attend this conference to obtain exposure to methodological perspectives that are not available in our graduate program. With respect to Han Soo‚??s qualifications, he is among the best graduate students I‚??ve supervised while at Texas A&M.  He has done exceedingly well in his methods courses, including econometrics, game theory, maximum likelihood, and time series. Because of this preparation, he should be intellectually prepared to benefit from the conference. 

His substantive field is American political institutions and behavior, and he has a strong grasp of this field. I know this must seem unusual for an Asian student, but it really is true. I would expect his poster to be well received, since it challenges major findings on legislative productivity by Mayhew and Kreihbel using better measures and more appropriate methods than were used in the original studies.. 

More generally, Han Soo is an impressive individual who takes great pride in his work and continually strives to fulfill his potential.  I believe that he will represent Texas A&M well at the conference and be a positive investment for the methods group for the future. I gladly give him my highest recommendation.

Sincerely,
 
B. Dan Wood
Professor and University Faculty Fellow
