	To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter to recommend Jeremy Albright. I have known Jeremy for the last five years during which I came to know him as an instructor; and as the chair of his dissertation committee.  Jeremy successfully defended his prospectus in July 2006 and is making good progress on the dissertation.  He recently submitted four chapters and is working on the next. Moreover, he recently had a single-authored paper accepted at Electoral Studies, a second-tier but respectable, peer-reviewed journal. All in all, I strongly recommend that you permit him to participate in the conference. 

Let me start out with one piece of important information. Jeremy is probably the best trained graduate student in methodology I have worked with at IU. Based on his performance in advanced statistical classes at IU and the ICPRS at Michigan, he was hired as a statistical consultant at IU‚??s Stat/Math Center. What is more, he is not just a ‚??number cruncher‚?ù‚??he is actually very interested in substantive questions. I feel very comfortable stating that he will eventually be able to teach a broad range of methods and substantive classes, both at the undergraduate and graduate level. 

Let me tell you a little bit about how I met Jeremy. I first got to know him when he took two graduate seminars from me. One seminar introduces students to the broad issues of comparative politics; a second seminar focuses more specifically on comparative political behavior. He performed very well in both seminars. This was not only reflected in his constructive contributions during seminar meetings but is also exemplified by the excellent research papers he wrote. What stands out about Jeremy is his inquisitive and sharp mind. He has an unusual ability to see through the mist of details to recognize the core of an argument. He thus clearly sees the promise and problems of published research faster than most of his peers at IU. What is more, writing also seems to come enviably easy to him: his papers are always well-organized and cogently written. 

Jeremy‚??s dissertation reflects his considerable strengths. It examines the campaign decisions which political parties make when designing election campaigns.  Surprisingly, few studies directly examine how parties make campaign decisions. To be sure, there are many country studies whose strength it is to provide detailed accounts of election campaigns. However, nearly all of them are descriptive and focus on a single nation; thus ignoring the broader, cross national perspective.  To fill this gap is the central purpose of Jeremy's dissertation.

 The dissertation is unique in its combination of rigorous quantitative analysis (using the Comparative Party Manifesto project which he merged with public opinion data) and a qualitative case study of election campaigns in Spain . He spent a year as a Fulbright and interviewed dozens of campaign managers in the various regions in Spain.  There is no other study I am aware of that addresses this question through a combination of broad-scale quantitative analyses and a detailed case study of election campaigns. I expect it to be a major contribution to the field of election politics in Western democracies. 

At the time of this writing (March 2008), I have read three chapters of the dissertation. The chapter provides an initial overview of party's campaign messages over time, and reveal one intriguing pattern: he finds that it is primarily the left of center parties which changed their campaign messages, whereas center-right parties by and large use the same campaign message over time. Why these changes are asymmetrical, and the degree to which this asymmetry emerges in all countries, will be the major theme in the chapters to come.

Finally, and fortunately, I don‚??t have to base my praise for Jeremy‚??s professionalism on promise alone. He recently had a paper accepted at Electoral Studies which presents some of the interview material from Spain. Importantly, while this study will probably become part of the dissertation in some form, he wrote the paper essentially as a pre-dissertation student. He is, in short, energetic, smart, and well-trained in his substantive and methodological areas  of interest. 

All in all, Jeremy is a thoughtful, creative, and independent individual.  He has strong potential to be a successful academic after completing his Ph.D., and his dissertation holds the promise to make an important contribution to election studies.  I recommend him strongly without reservations.

I have recently been confronting a number of issues tied to my efforts to develop techniques to measure legal and illegal trade linkages between states that go beyond traditional techniques economists employ. These techniques are problematic for conflict scholars employing trade data. I have been working on a large scale trade data project for the Correlates of War Project, but find official statistics and those released by the IMF inadequate. While I would like to present my work in this area, I feel it would be better for me to attend the methods meeting as an observer for the first time and apply at a later date to present a paper or poster. I hope you will consider my application. It would be extremely beneficial for me and my collaborators. 
I would be happy to discuss this with those reviewing my application.

Dear Selection Committee, 

Quintin Beazer is one of our top Ph.D. students in methodology and Comparative Politics. Quintin's dissertation uses the variation in the extent and strength of property rights in the postcommunist states as an opportunity to understand how political institutions constrain and motivate governmental elites. His dissertation research combines various analytical traditions in political science. Extensive fieldwork in Russia is laying the basis for a formal model of the interaction between government and business elites over the provision of secure property rights. The empirical implications of this model are then to be tested using an original cross-national dataset on property rights as well as World Bank business enterprise survey data. The resulting dissertation's potential is quite exciting, and we would consider Quintin one of the top two comparative-methods students at Ohio State in recent years (the other being Ryan Kennedy who attended the Methods meetings in 2007 and has been placed at the University of Houston). 

We have known and worked Quintin Beazer since he arrived at Ohio State University. He has worked as our research assistant (and, in Nooruddin's case, as co-author) and we have worked closely through his role as a fellow in the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM).  PRISM offers presentations on methods topics, software, and faculty and graduate student methodology consultation.  Quintin excelled at this. He could expertly explain the simplest technique to a wayward grad student as well as answer some of the faculty‚??s most complicated questions. It is a demanding role where you need to be very good at a variety of things given the diversity of methodological and programming questions you get as a PRISM Fellow. Two students are selected for the program each year and the competition has included postdocs who were not trained at Ohio State. Only our most promising students are selected.  

Through such contact, we have discovered that Quintin‚??s work is marked by an exceptional combination of virtues, chief among which are innovative ideas and methodological breadth and intuition. Quintin‚??s methods skills are also unique in that he is well versed and well trained in both quantitative and qualitative methods.  The diversity of training we can offer students on both the quantitative and qualitative side of methods is an advantage we have at OSU and Quintin has taken advantage of it. 

Quintin has identified an important and compelling dissertation project.  We are strongly impressed with his command of the literature and his alternative ways of researching and testing his ideas. Quintin‚??s work has important theoretical implications for our understanding of the economic trajectories of the post-communist states, as he proposes a move away from functionalist demand-side explanations of property rights towards more politically-nuanced theories of why politicians supply such institutions only at some times and in some places.  Furthermore, his research speaks directly to policy efforts aimed at establishing market economies in former communist countries.  Understanding the political factors that impede the development of secure property rights concerns not only those committed to supporting markets, but also relates to efforts to strengthen the emerging middle class, reduce violent conflict, and enhance investment opportunities in Russia and its neighboring countries. 

Methodologically, Quintin combines both quantitative and qualitative methods in his dissertation, therefore taking advantage of the breadth to training OSU offers.  His dissertation uses quantitative data, such as cross-national data from international development agencies, as well as archival data that he is collecting as part of his field work.  He uses multilevel modeling to capture accurately the factors operating at various levels on firm's expectations about and preferences for property rights in the post-communist states, and we expect him to contribute methodologically to this literature in his dissertation.  As a complement to his quantitative work, he uses qualitative case studies and elite field interviews to provide details about the actors, incentives, and processes of developing consistent property rights‚?? institutions.  As a result of his research design, he makes use of both variation across post-communist countries as well as within-unit variation over time.  

Quintin is also unique among our methods students in that beyond the traditional methodological skills of event history, time series, and panel data for students trained in our program, Quintin will receive a masters degree from the Economics Department this summer. He has training in formal theory as well as micro- and macro-economics to build a foundation for his political economy research. We are excited about the cohort of students now at Ohio State who are pursuing extensive training in methodology and comparative politics.  Comparative politics is traditionally the substantive field that is most under represented at the Political Methodology Meetings.  By attending the meetings, Quintin will gain important insights into current methods research and be better poised to contribute to the dialogue of innovations at the intersection of methods and comparative politics.  Given Quintin‚??s outgoing nature, we know that he will be engaged in the meeting and therefore contribute to the vibrancy of the dialogue even as a graduate student. 

Sincerely,

Irfan Nooruddin

Dear Members of Admission Committee,

I am writing this letter to support the application of Curtis Bell to the Society for Political Methodology 2008 Summer Meeting. I am the principal dissertation advisor of Curtis. He has also been a student of mine at the University of Colorado, Boulder in Fall 2007 (War and Peace) and in Fall 2008 (independent study, International Conflict and Global Governance). Of all the graduate students I have advised or had in my graduate classes, Curtis is without doubt the best student. He has several strengths which make him the finest graduate student that a PhD program would be only lucky to have. 

To start with his class performance, Curtis is undoubtedly in the top 1% category. In his enthusiasm for course material, preparation and involvement in class discussion, he is unquestionably dedicated to his graduate work. My War and Peace graduate class was designed for advanced graduate students and I had only a few first-year students. The students had to write several critical reviews throughout the semester which can be quite demanding and a full paper at the end of the semester. Curtis wrote the most thoughtful weekly essays. Besides, he had a thoroughly theorized and skillfully analyzed paper at the end of the semester which later became his qualifying paper. Also in the independent study that he took with me, Curtis prepared a thorough syllabus of the material that he would cover by the end of the semester. He assigned himself 5-6 page weekly papers and also worked on his qualifying paper. Independent studies heavily rely on self-monitoring and are a real challenge to graduate students. Curtis is such a motivated individual that he never missed an assignment, discussed the readings with me every week, put a tremendous effort in the reading material and prepared a superb qualifying paper in the meantime despite taking two other graduate classes. 

I would say without hesitation that Curtis Bell is the best graduate student in my department with a solid 4.0 GPA and astonishingly high student evaluations in his teaching work as an assistant. In my conversations with other faculty members, all professors that had any contact with Curtis talk very highly about him. They especially mention his being a serious student and self-motivating individual. This says a lot about the excellent relationships Curtis has with his professors, peers and students. 

Curtis has defended his qualifying paper this Spring semester before all his peers. He had an extremely novel idea about how democratic peace and autocratic peace literatures can productively be combined under the rubric institutional peace. I am certain that this argument will be his trademark in the democratic peace research in the very near future. Curtis is now preparing his qualifying paper for journal submission and will send it out to the Journal of Conflict Resolution in Summer 2008. Curtis has already started working on his prospectus while preparing for the comprehensive exams he will take in the Spring 2008. In the last three years, no student has passed exams with distinction in Political Science. Looking at Curt‚??s successful trajectory and his unending enthusiasm for social science, I have no doubt that Curtis will be the first student after years to receive the distinction. 

I believe that the POLMETH meeting will be crucial to Curt‚??s professional development. If given the opportunity, he will be presenting the major measurement and operationalization issues of the ‚??Institutional Peace‚?ù argument that will be his dissertation topic. Curtis will have the opportunity to interact with the excellent faculty that attends the Political Methodology Meetings and his peers around the country. He will have the chance to receive comments about ways to develop his empirical approach. Since he will be taking his comprehensive exams in methodology as well as in international relations, it will be uniquely beneficial for him to be exposed to the most recent developments in the methodology field. 

As the final word, I want to recommend Curtis Bell for the 2008 POLMETH Meeting without any hesitation. Based on my close observations of Curt in the last two years, I am confident that he is in the top 1% of graduate students around the country who have the professional enthusiasm and maturity to turn the meeting into a rewarding professional experience he will cultivate in the future. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about Curtis Bell.

Matt Blackwell is a highly talented student of political methodology. I got to know him during the year before he entered graduate school, when he worked with me
and James Honaker at UCLA. He helped us develop a new version of our software for imputing missing data, and he is the coauthor of one of the versions. I have also
worked with Matt some during his first year in graduate school here on the same project, and another one that is just getting started.

Matt was instrumental in our missing data project. He got up to speed extraordinarily fast, producing a sophisticated R package within six months of learning R. It
is not just that he‚??s learned how to pick up important tools, but that the types of problems for which we have come to rely on him have focused on critical thinking,
logical reasoning, and steadfast pursuit of some specific goal.

He is also highly motivated to learn about new methods and their applications. I see this from his regular visits to my office to ask for readings not part of his regular
classwork, and his attendance at our weekly applied statistics research workshop, normally attended by faculty around campus and more advanced students. All this
started happening in Matt‚??s first few months in graduate school. Other students have begun to rely on him for methods help with predictable regularity. He‚??s also
keeping up with the Statsitics Ph.D.s in their courses as well.

I strongly support Matt‚??s application and encourage you to contact me if you may desire any further information.
Sincerely,
~~

of causality in one way or another (natural experiments, iv's, Rubin
stuff). The project she proposes, which grows out of a completed
dissertation chapter, deals with the impact of leadership on growth in
democracies and autocracies, and makes an important and interesting
point that what some prominent researchers found was a LATE which
might be far from the ATE of interest. It is quite a nice substantive
finding which has a good basis in both comparative politics and
methodology, and would make a very nice poster. 

Anjali is exactly the type of person I think we want to encourage; we
will have more success encouraging good comparativists to be serious
methods people rather than taking top methodologists and trying to
make them good comparativists. So Anjali would benefit a lot from this
meeting. It will also obviously be important to her in terms of the job
market in the Fall.

Anjali has the appropriate coursework (the usual advanced maximum
likelihood stuff plus the causality stuff) to really benefit from the
meeting.

Anjali is the first NYU student I have talked to about attending the
meeting. I have no idea who else has applied. Thus you can infer
nothing about my ranking of NYU students from this recommendation. I
would be happy to help you rank our students if you wish.","Beck","Nathaniel ","Chair, Poliics","NYU","nathaniel.beck@nyu.edu","2126734565","received","6042","Beck","Nathaniel ","Chair, Politics","NYU","nathaniel.beck@nyu.edu","2126734565","approved","8769","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2008-05-07","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","Vegetarian","","","Yes","","Yes","","","","","","","Complete"

I am writing to strongly support his application to attend the methods meetings in Ann Arbor this summer. I have known Michael as a student, a research assistant, and advisee. He is defending his dissertation proposal on March 31st. 

Brogan‚??s will be writing a dissertation on economic voting. His basic premise is that there is an interaction effect between economic perceptions and the political context. Brogan proposes that economic voting is strongest when the economy is perceived as weak and is weakest when the economy is perceived as doing well. I think his dissertation holds great promise as some researchers are coming to believe that economic perceptions are endogenous, determined by partisanship (for example Evans and Anderson 2006). Michael will be using instrumental variables techniques to exogenize the economic perceptions variables. He will be testing his hypothesis using data from the US and Great Britain. Presenting his research at the methods meetings this summer will be invaluable to his dissertation research.

Brogan exemplifies the successful student the CUNY Graduate Center admitted five years ago (we are now giving more aid and recruiting more full-time students). Brogan is hard-working, tireless, and committed to political science. He works full-time to support himself and pay for tuition and commutes long hours to evening classes. Michael is the budget officer in the provost‚??s office at Rider University where he works with the university‚??s institutional data daily. This experience and his educational background make him well suited to participate in the methods conference this summer.

Michael has the determination and ability to complete a dissertation that will make a real contribution to the field of economic voting. I hope you give him the opportunity to learn from the best in the field and to share his work with his peers. He deserves the opportunity and will make the most of it.

Sincerely,

I am pleased to recommend Gail Buttorff for the 2008 Political Methodology Summer Meeting. As a faculty member at the University of Iowa I have had Buttorff in three of my classes and can say without reservation that she has the most potential of any graduate student I have encountered in my seven years here. What first distinguished her was her ability to come up with interesting and timely ideas for research projects - her particular talent is in identifying important research questions in relatively unexplored areas. In addition, she brings a strong emphasis on rigorous theorizing to help guide her inquiry, having a background in economics and having taken many courses in both formal theory and political methodology at Iowa.

While Buttorff is in her third year in the program, I was on leave during her first two years. Despite this, I have had a chance to get her know and her work quite well in the last six months. Last semester she took my advanced quantitative methods course (discrete choice, event history and event count), and received the second highest final grade out of fifteen students. One of the requirements of the course is for students to participate in a poster summarizing their research projects. The entire department is invited to attend and evaluate the posters in order to help select a winner of the best poster award. Buttorff‚??s poster was one of two winners this year and received high praise from other faculty members. Her project focused around electoral fraud in the Reconstruction-era U.S., using Walter Mebane‚??s work on Benford‚??s second-digit Law to test for the possibility of electoral fraud in Presidential elections. Her results indicate the presence of substantial amounts of potential fraud; in particular in some Southern states (the results for Texas were particularly worrisome).

I believe Buttorff‚??s willingness to learn new techniques like the 2BL test speaks well about her capabilities of being an intelligent consumer of advanced political methodology. Almost all of the students in the class end up applying one of the estimators I teach in their research, but none of these was appropriate for the type of question and data that she had available. So after a few conversations about various topics, and after learning of her interest in electoral fraud and boycotts, I suggested she take a look at Mebane‚??s papers and think about applying the techniques to elections in the Middle East, her substantive area of interest. Buttorff quickly digested the 2BL technique but had some difficulties obtaining her original data, so she chose to apply it in a historical context.

This semester she is enrolled in two more of my courses‚?? another on statistics and one on testing formal models of politics. While the semester is only halfway completed, I have high hopes for her in these courses as well. Buttorff has also been a regular participant in a formal theory reading group that I and a couple of other faculty members have organized. 

I believe that Buttorff‚??s research would benefit greatly from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting. It would give her the opportunity to interact with methodologists interested in a variety of topics. In particular, I believe she would value the opportunity to meet methodologists who work primarily in comparative politics. Her research is also quite intelligent and she would benefit from the opportunity to present a poster and discuss it with the methods community.

To whom it may concern:

I am delighted to write this letter on behalf of Ms Roulan Chen, who is currently applying for funding enabling him to continue her advanced graduate studies.  Roulan was a student in the second semester of my sequence of graduate courses on Chinese politics in spring semester 2004.   semester.   Although the requirements for this sequence were quite rigorous, involving a major research paper,  Roulan did outstanding work, earning and A+ for the course, a grade I very rarely give.   Aside from her very perceptive insights into East Asian politics Roulan is distinguished by her methodological training in quantitative approaches, formal modeling, and the like.  I am duly grateful to her contribution to my own work on the correlation of leadership splits with the PRC political business cycle.  In the spring of 2006 she was the first student in seven years to pass thedepartment's methods exam, thereby completing her PhD prelims.  This achievement was followed in Fall Semester of 2006 by passage of her PhD oral exam, in which she presented a very ambitious prospectus on the national identity of Taiwan.  The dissertation will be split between the analysis of survey data on the island on Taiwanese feelings about ethnic and national identity on the one hand, and the analysis of the feelings of the estimated 500,000-1,000,000 diaspara community of Taiwanese who have now taken up permanent residence on the Chinese mainland to pursue their livelihoods on the other.  While the former has now received some attention, including for example a special issue of Asian Survey, empirical analysis of the Taiwanese diaspara on the mainland is truly a pioneering venture.  Thus her dissertation research, pursued as it will be in the most methodologically sophisticated fashion, is certain to be new and extremely interesting.  Yet the research itself is also apt to be costly, both in the analysis of large data sets in Taiwan and even more for the original survey research on the Chinese mainland.
 
Ms Chen has done extraordinarily well during his still brief stay here, having earned a cumulative GPA of 3.87.  Yet she has not hitherto received adequate research funding, and I am concerned.  Based on the cumulative quality of her work during the time I have known her, I think that I can testify that this brilliant young scholar is highly motivated and has extraordinary research and analytical skills.  She also has a positive disposition and an upright, courteous character.  I am happy to give her my very highest recommendation, and would be happy to consult with you further if you have any questions about this letter.

Sincerely,

With this letter, I give my strong support to Jowei Chen's application to attend the 2008 Methods Meetings.  

I've come to know Jowei quite well, despite my short period of time at Stanford.  I have been consistently impressed by the quality of his work -- indeed, he already has several publications in top tier journals -- and by the methodological sophistication of his analysis.  I am confident that Jowei will prove to be among the most promising of current and recent cohorts studying American politics at Stanford (a group that includes Neil Malhotra John Bullock, and Dan Butler).
  
Jowei's current research project uses the allocation of FEMA grants in Florida in 2004 to develop and evaluate formal-theoretic models of targeted distributive spending.  Jowei uses data acquired through a Freedom of Information Act request, that report the distributed outcome of every FEMA claim (as well as the amount requested, street address, etc.),  to demonstrates that FEMA allocation process was structured by partisan incentives:  The Republican administration concentrated benefits in Republican precincts.  The especially challenging part this research project lies in generating estimates of what the distribution of FEMA grants would have been, in the absence of partisan incentives to target these grants towards their core constituency.  To overcome this challenge, Jowei has incorporated measures of the severity of the hurricanes through the spatial analysis of raster data.  Jowei is currently expanding this project to explore whether and how voters respond to these explicitly targeted benefits.  In particular, Jowei is interested in whether income groups vary in their electoral responsiveness to FEMA grants.  

Jowei has recognized in the FEMA grant allocation data an important analytic opportunity to evaluate our current understanding of distributive politics in the absence of the confounding effects of the institutions of Congress and incumbency advantages, and without the measurement challenges associated with identifying pork-barrel projects.  This research will make an important contribution to the study of electorally-motivated public spending.

Without a doubt, Jowei will be an active and contributing participant in this summer's Methods Meetings.  Should you have any questions about this recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me: kljusko@stanford.edu, 650-724-9906.

I have worked closely with Daina since he enrolled in the PhD program at Rice University.  Daina is the top student in our program and in my opinion he is the best student to have passed through our program yet.  I have co-authored three papers with Daina, and I plan to chair his dissertation committee.  I have also had Daina in three graduate seminar courses.  He earned the highest grade in each and clearly demonstrated his analytical and writing ability on the assignments and final paper.  I have very high expectations for Daina's dissertation project, and I believe that attending the Political Methodology summer conference will be a formative experience, as it was for me.  In the dissertation Daina will develop a formal model of WTO dispute settlement, test propositions from the model with new data, and conduct a laboratory experiment.  This dissertation will be very much in the spirit recent work in political methodology.  Daina plans to use a QRE model to motivate both the empirical and experimental analysis.  Since the AQRE model and experimental design is appears regularly at the summer conference, it is a perfect venue for Daina to refine the tools necessary for his dissertation research.  Please consider Daina's application carefully and feel free to contact me with any questions.

Dear Selection Committee,

	It is our pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Dino Christensen.  Dino is one of the top ten students we have had in the department.  He works in the field of methodology and political behavior and is currently working with Bo Lu in the OSU Biostatistics Department as well.  Dino is using Lu‚??s alternative matching procedure to examine the role and interaction of individual political information and campaign exposure.  Lu‚??s method allows one to match on similar covariates and also match individuals on their difference in the treatment.  It is the latter part that distinguishes Lu‚??s method.  Substantively, this approach fits perfectly with Dino‚??s project.  That is, Dino can then match on different campaign exposure, which cannot be controlled apriori.  This project would be the subject of his methods presentation.  

	Dino also has an active research agenda beyond the dissertation work.  He has a project with a fellow graduate student, Cory Smidt (beginning at Michigan State in the fall), which we are very excited about: The Visible Primary of 2008 (see www.visibleprimary.com).  Starting in the summer of 2007, Dino and Cory use daily automated content coding of newspaper websites, coupled with a collection of statewide polls, to measure and test the dynamic mechanisms of presidential primary campaigns. To date they have collected over 1100 primary campaign articles across more than 300 days and a dozen key newspapers, including newspapers with both national and local distributions. Their data set will allow them to look at questions such as:  How much do candidates‚?? local, as opposed to national, media profiles relate to primary success? Does frontloading increase or decrease the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire momentum? How do campaigns react to the agendas and rhetoric of the opposition and the news media?  How does press attention and coverage differ by a candidate‚??s poll standings? How persistent is primary momentum and what explains its persistence? The data set will be a great source of data to answer fundamental questions in political behavior.    

	We have both worked closely with Dino‚??s through a variety of contact, including having him in class, reading his papers, having him as a research assistant, coauthoring with him, serving on his dissertation committee, and having the pleasure of working with him in the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM). So we know him and his talents well. Through such contact, we have discovered that his work is marked by an exceptional combination of virtues, chief among which are innovative ideas and strong methodological skills.

	Dino was selected as this year‚??s senior PRISM fellow. Through PRISM he assists faculty and graduate students with their methods questions and data analysis problems. He excels at this, which bodes well for his future as a methodologist.

	Dino has published in Political Behavior. This is a collaborative paper that began as a conference presentation, and was extended with Dino‚??s efforts into the final product. He was responsible for most of the data analysis, but also contributed actively to the writing and determining the shape of the paper and the final article. He is fun to work with because he has the too rare talent of thinking outside the box.

	Dino is an excellent colleague because of his ‚??people skills.‚?ù Additionally, he has a fine pedigree, as an undergraduate student of Chris Achen‚??s at Michigan before he went to Chicago for his Master‚??s degree and then joined us in Columbus. The extent of his professional experience is notable and reflects his organizational and administrative talents as well as his friendly nature.

	We fully support Dino‚??s application because he has all the early trademarks of an outstanding scholar. His persistence and dedication to his work and the profession are noteworthy. Dino is professionalized and ambitious and is sure to take advantage of the opportunities for discussion and engagement offered by the Political Methodology Meeting.  

Sincerely,

Meghan has performed superbly in our graduate program and boasts an interesting collection of methods skills.

Meghan is a third year student at the University of Wisconsin whose fields of study are American Politics and Methods.  She is also a fellow with the University of Wisconsin's Interdisciplinary Training Program in Education Sciences, a program focused on causal inference and quantitative methodology in education research.  Her interests in methodology include issues in measurement and causal inference.  

As a graduate student Meghan has pursued opportunities to develop her methodological skills at every turn.  In addition to the standard statistics sequence that most of our students take, she has taken Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Charles Franklin, Potential Outcomes Inference with Jake Bowers (via iTV), Item Response Theory with Dan Bolt, and Experimental Design with Jee Seon Kim.  Meghan also attended the Scientific Software International Workshop on Hierarchical Linear Modeling in 2007.

Her methodologically sophisticated research includes an article titled ‚??The Illusion of Technique: How Method-Driven Research Leads Welfare Scholarship Astray,‚?ù coauthored with Joe Soss, Matthew Holleque, and Amber Wichowsky.  She was a coauthor with Sheree Schrager of ‚??When Theory and Practice Meet: Lessons from an Urban District School-Randomized Trial,‚?ù presented at the 2008 meeting of the American Education Research Association.  

This latter project speaks particularly well to Meghan‚??s ongoing research interests as it evaluates the threats to internal validity confronted while conducting a large multi-year field experiment in Los Angeles public schools.  Her dissertation project employs an ambitious field experiment in several dozen Wisconsin schools to evaluate the effects of classroom skils practice on civic engagement.  Backed by some initial statistical support provided by analysis of cross-sectional surveys, Meghan will use to her expertise in the design of experiments and causal models to test for these relationships in the field.

In short, I strong endorse Meghan Condon‚??s application to present a poster at the summer methods meeting.  She is well-trained, professional, and sure to make a positive impression at the conference.

It is my great pleasure to write a letter supporting the application of Bruce Desmarais for the 2008 Summer Methods meeting.  Bruce and I both arrived at UNC 2 years ago, and I have been closely involved with Bruce since that time.  I chair his thesis committee, he and I are collaborating with two other students on an experimental project currently under review at TESS (Bruce and one of the other students have been the leaders on that effort), and I talk with him on a weekly basis about his various projects.  In short, I know Bruce very well and am well-positioned to write this letter.  Quite simply, Bruce is one of the three most impressive students I have ever encountered at this stage of his career and I highly recommend him.

The poster he proposes to present is based on work he has done for his thesis.  What began with a substantive question in American politics has worked its way backward into what might be a foundational paper on the use of survival/event history models both in political science and across other fields of study.  Bruce has put his finger on what appears to be a source of bias in the estimation of survival models that raises questions about a substantial amount of published research in political science as well as in other fields. Bruce rightly notes that most survival models, both parametric and semi-parametric, are estimated with the assumption that a continuous distribution characterizes the baseline hazard.  However, scholars inevitably measure the occurrence of an event (and thus, the time from the origin until the event occurs) in a manner that imposes a discreteness to the data that scholars have at hand to analyze.  Such a measurement strategy is largely unavoidable.  However, Bruce has demonstrated both analytically and through simulations that his measurement process causes bias in standard survival models.  Furthermore, Bruce has discovered a solution to this problem through the application of a model typically applied in a different setting, but a setting that manifests a problem that is fundamentally the same.  Bruce‚??s paper will conclude with a re-analysis of several published survival models to demonstrate the substantive importance of both the problem he has identified and his solution for it.  Bruce has already completed a substantial amount of work on this project, and his conclusions regarding both the nature of the problem and his proposed solution appear to be quite robust.  I have every confidence that his final poster will constitute a substantial piece of work and that the published paper that will follow will be very influential.

Bruce is extremely well prepared to complete this analysis.  Bruce came to UNC with previous graduate training in Economics and one of the strongest sets of mathematical and programming skills that I have seen in any graduate student.  In his two years in the department, Bruce has established himself as one of the strongest graduate students we have seen at his stage, particularly in methods.  He has taken advanced computational Econ classes outside our department and has interacted with leading methods people in other departments both at UNC and at Duke.  For example, the work on survival models he proposes for his poster led Bruce to meet with one of the leading Biostatistics scholars in the country who happens to be here at UNC.  In short, Bruce is ambitious, extremely bright, and has an exceptional set of skills which he applies tirelessly in his work.  He is recognized by both faculty and other students in our department as a roll model and valuable colleague.  He is also a good guy and just a delight to work with.  I highly recommend Bruce without reservation.

Thank you for your consideration.  If you have any questions or require any additional information, please feel free to contact me directly (carsey@unc.edu).

I am writing to express my strong support or Andy Eggers' application to attend the 2008 summer meeting. I've known Andy for over 4 years now and I think very highly of him and his abilities. I think he should definitely be allowed to attend the summer meeting. 

I first me Andy when he took my graduate Bayesian inference inference class as a first year student. He did very well in the course and he impressed me with both his good taste in modeling and interest in really getting to the bottom of foundational questions. He has since worked for me as both a TF (the Harvard equivalent of a TA) and as an RA. He has done / continues to do great work in both capacities. 

Andy is very good at both statistics and programming. He reads widely and is a very creative problem solver. He's very interested in statistical natural language processing (NLP) and his programming skills really work to his advantage here. I think there is a good chance that he will do important work at the intersection of statistical NLP and political science.  

The poster that I think Andy is proposing looks at the financial returns to office in the UK House of Commons. He and a coauthor do a ton of original data collection to get the assets of MPs (and those who ran for office but lost)  at the time of their death. Using a number of clever identification strategies they produce very believable estimates for the increase in wealth associated with serving in the Commons. This is a really nice paper. I'm quite sure it will be placed in a major journal in the not too distant future.   

Overall, Andy is an extremely strong student who would really benefit from attending the summer meeting. 

To be clear about my ranking of students that I wrote for this year, my ranking is (from strongest to least strong):

Mike Kellermann &gt; Andy Eggers = Dan Pemstein &gt; Ben Goodrich

Kevin Quinn

Jason has a deep interest in statistical methods and would benefit greatly from participating.

Jason Engle is a first year Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Wisconsin.  He arrived in our program highly recommended, having earned a masters degree in public affairs and policy analysis from the La Follette School at UW.  He also has four years of experience in education research, including two years at the Wisconsin State Department of Public Instruction conducting program evaluation and overseeing technical issues related to the state examination required under No Child Left Behind.  His interests include education policy, political methodology, standardized testing, and the ideology of public education.

Jason‚??s training in EITM-style statistical work is especially impressive for a first year student.  As a masters student he picked up a number of valuable courses in economics and multivariate statistics.  Since joining our program he has gone well beyond the typical statistics sequence taken by many of our students, and has sought out courses in Game Theory, Test Theory, Measurement, and Spatial Analysis.   

In conclusion, I solidly endorse Jason Engle‚??s application to participate in this summer‚??s methods meeting.  He is a sophisticated and curious methodologist who will make the most of the opportunity.

He also has the high-end technical skills to develop new estimators when necessary to accomplish these tests.  Justin‚??s proposed paper is a part of a larger project that offers a formal model of executive control over the bureaucracy, predictions from which are tested both experimentally in the laboratory, and with a non-experimental design using data on enforcement of environmental standards by regional Environmental Protection Agency offices.

No one is better qualified to assess his abilities.  I have known Jeremiah for three and a half years in many different capacities from research assistant to student in my political behavior seminar to collaborator on scholarly work.  Earlier in the academic year, he successfully defended his dissertation prospectus with flying colors under my direction.  At present, he has drafts of several chapters complete, and the poster that he is proposing for this conference will play an integral role in his dissertation as well.  In short, he is at the perfect stage in his graduate career to make maximum use of this opportunity.

	Let me first talk about Jeremiah in relative terms both inside and outside our department.  He is, without doubt, the most promising student that Vanderbilt‚??s political science program has to offer.  He has remarkable methods skills.  He has blown through the methods sequence here and is now serving as a TA for our most advanced methods class.  Of course, ours is not a program known for its methodological sophistication.  But I believe that he compares favorably on the methods end of things with the very best students at the very best political science departments in the country.  As evidence, he distinguished himself as the top student in a very challenging Bayesian statistics course taught at the ICPSR summer program by Jeff Gill.  In fact, Jeff wrote to tell me that Jeremiah knew the material better than his TA did by the end of the session.  

	The project that Jeremiah has proposed for the Methods meeting is a rigorous effort to measure legislator ideal points in an issue domain, gay rights, where there are a relatively small number of votes in any given congress.  This data limitation makes it hard to differentiate among members, particularly at the extremes of the ideological distribution in this issue area.  Jeremiah is attempting to use the sponsorship and co-sponsorship of initiatives to overcome the problem in one of two ways.  He has already derived estimates using a dichotomous measure of co-sponsorship with some success.  But he is also working on adding more precision to the estimates by using a finer measure of support for the agenda, namely the number of days that it took for a member to sign onto a bill.  His work will no doubt generate considerable interest and has the potential to provide deeper insights into the scholarly understanding of gay rights.

That Jeremiah would excel in his high end methods work comes as no surprise.  He earned a near perfect score on the GRE quantitative section, and he was a physics major in college.  Given the level of math he was exposed to as an undergraduate, there is very little (if anything) on the political methodology front that seems to intimidate him.  Of course, he doesn‚??t know the solution to every problem, but he isn‚??t afraid to try to figure out the solution to any problem.  

	If I can be of any further assistance in helping you assess Jeremiah, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My telephone number is (615)322-6240, and my email address is marc.j.hetherington@vanderbilt.edu.

This letter of recommendation is written on behalf of Daniel Gillion, who is seeking acceptance into the 25th Annual Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.  This recommendation is easy to write, as I have worked closely with Daniel in various capacities, chief of which is that I am Chair of his dissertation committee.  I have also seen Daniel make various presentations and have been very much impressed with his presentation skills.

Daniel is a forth-year graduate student who is currently well along in the research and writing of his thesis.  He has successfully completed our rigorous methods sequence and has sat in on addition methods courses, so he is in a good position to take advantage of and contribute to the methods conference.  Daniel has demonstrated his high level of academic training in a professional setting by presenting substantive papers that nonetheless incorporated complicated methods at the annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, the Southern Political Science Association, and the National Conference of Black Political Scientists

Daniel is not a political methodologist, but he is a well-trained graduate student who is looking to apply sophisticated political methods to address questions in race and ethnic politics.  Along with benefits to Daniel himself, his attendance will further the use of advanced statistical techniques in a subfield that has often failed to display much methodological sophistication.  Daniel's desire to attend the conference not only shows the overall progression of the field of race and ethnic politics, but it also reflects the growth and diversity of the Political Methods Conference.

At the conference, Daniel will present a poster that looks to connect citizens' political behavior to governmental responsiveness by applying a Markov regime-switching model with endogeneity.  This model allows him to offer insight on how shifts between a racially conscientious society and a non-racially conscientious society affect the parameters used to estimate governmental responsiveness toward citizen's behavior on racial and ethnic issues.

Given Daniel's academic training, research area, and professional prowess I believe he will be a great addition to the 25th Annual Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.

Sincerely,
Richard G. Niemi

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am pleased to write in support of Daniel Gillian?s application to present a poster at the Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. Daniel is a fourth year student in our Ph.D. program. I did not have Daniel as a student in any of my methods classes because he had already completed the entire sequence before I arrived at Rochester, but I have advised him on various projects since.

Daniel?s current research employs sophisticated time-series methods to the field of race and politics. One of his recent projects (which he would like to present as a poster in the summer meeting) employs a Markov switching model.

Daniel has demonstrated a high level of professionalism by presenting at the major political science conferences and conferences in his subfield. Attending the summer methods meeting is a natural next step in his career. I this he will benefit greatly from the opportunity to present his work to a methods audience and will benefit from interacting with other young political methodologists.

I am confidant that Daniel would benefit a great deal from the opportunity to attend the summer methods meeting and am happy to recommend him for this program. Please contact me should you have any questions.

Sincerely yours,

Michael Peress

I am writing on behalf of Ben Goodrich. I've known Ben for about
four years now and I know him and his abilities well. Ben is a
strong student who is very interested in political methodology. I
think his technical skills are definitely better than all but perhaps
25 percent of the graduate students who have attended the summer
methods meeting the past few years. In short, I definitely think he
should be allowed to participate in the meeting. 

Ben has taken an advanced class (Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling) from
me and has served as an RA for me. Ben did well in
the class and he has continued to improve his knowledge of Bayesian
inference and statistical computing. As an RA for me he has written a
reasonable amount of computer code in both R and C++. He has very good
skills and will likely attract  attention when he goes on the
job market. 

The project that Ben has proposed for the methods meeting combines
work on Procrustes transformations as a means to post-process MCMC
output from models that are not likelihood identified but for which
identified functionals of model parameters exist with work on
variable dimension MCMC. I have not seen the finished paper but Ben
has informed me of what he is working on and the project seems to
have promise. 

In short, Ben is a good student who should certainly attend the
methods meeting-- both for his own good and the good of others at the
meeting. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide additional
information. 

Sincerely,
Kevin Quinn

the Summer Methodology Meeting. Melanie is a 4th year PhD student
at NYU. I serve as her dissertation advisor.  Melanie has taken
our standard econometrics sequence, as well as an econometrics course
with Bill Greene in NYU's business school, and the Bayesian course
with Jeff Gill at ICPSR.

Melanie is writing an excellent dissertation on partisanship in the
United States. This is such a well-trod topic in american politics
that it is hard to believe that someone has something new to say. But
Melanie does have a valuable contribution to make. There are two
prevailing views of partisanship in the literature. One camp contends
that partisanship is acquired via socialization from family and
friends. Another camp contends that partisanship is based on a
rational comparision of performance of the two parties and the issue
positions of the two parties: voters are expected to identify with the
party that they have enjoyed better economic times under, or the party
that offers a set of issue positions more to their liking.  Both camps
say relatively little about independents, voters who choose not to
identify with any political party. One camp says that independents are
indifferent between the parties.

Melanie approaches the problem of partisanship with the insight that
a voter may choose to be independent simply because no major party is
talking about the issues most important to the voter. While this is a
straightforward idea, it has surprisingly powerful implications. It
suggests that the parties have more influence over partisanship than
many people would predict. And it no longer treats independents as
outside of the realm of political competition.

While the basic idea Melanie has is straightforward, testing her
claims is quite difficult.  She first needs to measure what individual
voters think is important,  and she needs to measure what issues parties
are emphasizing.  She first tried to measure what voters are thinking
using the coding of the 'Most Important Issue' question from the
National Election Studies that comes with the public release data.
She came up with dissapointing results. But everyone who has seen
her work agrees that the data is such a crude measure that she
cannot reach any conclusion based on it.

She has an excellent scheme  to create a better measure of what voters
think is important. She requested the
raw responses to survey questions from the American National Election
Studies going back to 1984 that directly ask respondents what they
feel is the most important problem facing the country, and she has 
developed a method to code these responses in such a way as to
identify issues that voters think are important that can be matched
to what parties are saying.  Coding of these
responses is currently available in the public release of the American
National Election Study, however it is far too crude for Melanie's
purpose.  This is a complicated endeavor: the problem is to reduce the
1500 individual responses in a given year to a finite set of issues
which can then be compared to the issues the parties are discussing.
And the key to doing this in such a way that is useful it is to create 
a finite set of issue where the issues have NOT been chosen by the
analyst.  

Melanie has a good idea of how to do this. Many of the responses are
very brief: one, two, or three words. Melanie came up with the insight
that such responses themselves can define the issue set. This means
that the responents, rather than the analyst are defining the issue
set. This is the key contribution of Melanie's method. She then
implements this very carefully though a mix of python code that
implements a well defined coding algorithim, and human coding.

Melanie will later be combining this data on what voters think with
a sophisticated textual analysis of a combination of nominating
acceptance speeches by presidential candidates, and media coverage
of candidates to determine what issues the parties were emphasizing.
This is also a major undertaking, but one that she is in a good
position to do.  Along with myself, Mik Laver, who has done considerable
work on textual analysis of party platforms, sits on her committee.

Melanie was invited to present her basic model (and a preliminary test
of it using very crude data) at the 2007 Annual Summer Meeting of the
Political Methodology Society. The work was very well received, as
have been Melanie's other conference presentations.  Since then,
she has developed and implemented her coding scheme (which required
he to learn Python). Presenting it at the 2008 meeting would give
her a chance to get feedback on the scheme.


I strongly urge you to accept Melanie's proposal. In addition to the
immediate intellectual merit of Melanie's work on partisanship,
and the contribution she is making in offering a method of how
to code important data on public opinion, it would be nice to see
someone at the Michigan meeting working in a very innovative way
with the NES data!!

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would 
like additional information.

I have known Justin Grimmer since he took my class in advanced political methodology. He did so well, I chose him to be the teaching assistant for the subsequent year. Those who have been in this position now teach at many top departments nationwide (Michigan, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Rochester, etc.), and I certainly expect the same from Justin. The paper Justin wrote in my class develops a model for compositional data. These are data that have a set of outcome variables, each with values between zero and
one and which together sum to one, such as votes in multiparty systems or the proportion of time spent on each of a list of activities. The methods used in these
models typically involve the multivariate logistic distribution to map the data from the simplex to unbounded space and so a key problem is when some variables have
true zero values. Justin and his coauthor developed a model that enabled these true zeros as an integral part of the model, which should be very useful even outside the
interesting substantive example he analyzed.

Justin has also developed an innovative Bayesian model for analyzing rolling crosssection data, which is an increasingly common method of survey analysis in political
science. The model smooths appropriately over time, while still enabling accurate estimation within each independent survey. The work proposes a solution to the
problems posed by Brady and Johnston in a book on these types of data. I believe the approach Justin has taken will see widespread use, as it gives answers when
other approaches fail, and its assumptions are more substantively plausible.

Recently, Justin and I have been working on a method of clustering text documents including legislator press releases, open ended survey questions, emails, etc. He
has shown himself to be highly technically sophisticated with a deep and intuitive understanding of political methodology and the foundational aspects of math and
statistics. He has all the characteristics of someone who will become a leader in the field of American politics and political methodology.

Justin‚??s dissertation is in a sense a modern version of Fenno‚??s Home Style. It asks some of the same questions, but whereas Fenno could follow only a few legislators
around and read a small number of press releases, Justin has already gathered and enormous amount of information, including 6,000 press releases and a large body of
other information. This may well represent the largest body of information ever collected on legislators‚?? presentation of self to their constituents. He has also extended
some of the methodological work we worked on together into a new framework capable of responding to the challenges these data present. He also has a set of arguably
exogenous factors (unexpected deaths) to study the effects of committee assignment on legislative priorities.
Justin has my very strong support. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information.
Sincerely,
~~

I have not previously had the opportunity to attend due to scheduling conflicts, and thus I would like to be an attendee for my first methods meeting. In terms of methods, my research interests lately have focused on IRT models and multidimensional scaling--as these methods relate to the estimation of ideal points of members of the federal executive branch and Congress (work I'm conducting with Anthony Bertelli). This work has yielded publications and R&Rs at the Journal of Politics and American Politics Research thus far. I am currently working on a broad project (with Bertelli) to estimate the issue space for all federal agencies, presidents, and members of Congress using similar methods. My methods interests also include measurement theory, Bayesian statistics, selection models, time-series models, and the  empirical testing of the implications of formal models.

I am writing to offer my very enthusiastic support for Jens Haimueller‚??s application to present a poster at the 2008 Society for Political Methodology Summer Meeting. Jens is currently a third year Ph.D. student in the Government department and I am his dissertation advisor. I have known Jens since he first came to Harvard and joined my course on Econometric Program Evaluation Methods. In the following year, Jens served as the excellent teaching assistant for the same course. 

Jens is an exceptionally gifted individual, and his performance in graduate school easily puts him into the top 1-5% of all our doctoral students. Jens is exceptionally well tuned into academic research mode and has an outstanding grasp of the methodological literature in statistics and political methodology. He has a demonstrated track record of success in graduate school as evident by the fact that he has already published several quantitative articles in leading political science journals (for example, International Organization and Electoral Studies) and also Statistics journals (for example, Journal of Statistical Software). 

He has also written excellent recent papers on balance tests for matching estimators, a quasi-experimental study of the effect of foreign free media on autocratic regime stability, and a quasi-experimental study estimating returns to office in post-war British politics all of which are currently under review. Another recent paper that resulted from our joint work on synthetic control methods (currently under review), has won the 2007 Gosnell Prize for Excellence in Political Methodology. The companion software to this paper, which Jens wrote for R and Stata last year has already been widely used for program evaluations by organizations such as the World Bank, the IMF, or the Bureau of Labour Statistics.

At the conference, Jens intends to present one of his dissertation papers. The paper focuses on synthetic matching methods that Jens has developed by building on recent developments in the literature on exponential tilting and survey weighting adjustments. Synthetic matching methods allow researchers to reweight control groups so that they perfectly match several moments of the covariate distributions of the treatment group. The reweighting scheme is quite general and provides several advantages over conventional matching techniques. In particular, reweighting obviates the often tedious search for a good propensity score specification because balance is directly incorporated into the weight function using a potentially large set of balance constraints. This allows estimating treatment effects with minimal approximation error since much higher standards of covariate balance are achieved. 

There is no doubt in my mind that Jens has an extremely productive academic career ahead of him and that his dissertation work will have a large impact on the field of political methodology. Presenting this work at the Summer Meeting would give him a unique opportunity to receive valuable feedback. I wholeheartedly support his application.

Dominik is my PhD student at the University of Bern and he is easily the best graduate student I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Indeed, he is so advanced that I‚??d rather think of him as a colleague than a student.

For someone who completed his MA just recently, Dominik has already amassed a sizable publication record. He is co-authoring with leading scholars in the field of political methodology such as Jeff Gill. He has been invited to work for Gary King at Harvard. He has acquired funding from the city of Zurich for a major project evaluating that city‚??s drug policy. In other words, he has put together an impressive record in a very short time.

In terms of teaching, he has played an instrumental role in a course on causal analysis that I started offering in Bern. While his formal title was that of a TA, he really was a co-instructor. Earlier in his studies, he was a highly successful TA/instructor in several methodologically oriented courses offered in the Department of Sociology at Bern.

Dominik‚??s great strengths lie in the areas of causal inference and Bayesian statistics. However, he has received extensive training across the entire spectrum of methods that are routinely used in political analysis. There should be no question then that he is in an excellent position to take full advantage of all that the PolMeth conference has to offer.

The poster that he has proposed concerns an area of research that interests us both: choice models. This is an application of Manski‚??s probabilistic choice set model that Dominik, Carole Wilson, and I have begun to apply in the political domain. The model is used here to address the substantive puzzle of how class influences vote choice and how this has changed over time, taking British elections as the basis. Methodologically, this paper moves well beyond the Manski model and its recent incarnations, giving it a Bayesian twist that helps to overcome identification issues inherent in the model. As such, the research seems well-suited for the PolMeth meetings.

In conclusion, I sincerely hope that you will honor Dominik Hangartner‚??s application. He is an extremely bright young methodologist. I am sure that he will make a most positive contribution to the meetings.

I have worked closely with Steve as he has developed his dissertation topic.   Steve is proposing to do cutting edge research on the theoretical implications of uncertainty in games and strategic actions.   He is exploring alternative specifications of quantal response models, using theory, simulations, and laboratory experiments.  In particular, he proposes a clever experimental design that should sort out whether the underlying uncertainty is related to actions or payoffs.  This in turn should have implications for understanding such real-world negotiation situations as agenda control models in legislatures.

I strongly support his participation at the summer meeting.

Hartman to the 25th Annual Summer Meeting of the Society for Political
Methodology. Erin is one of the most outstanding graduate students in
the Department of Political Science at the University of California,
Berkeley.  She has all of the making of a first rate methodologist.
She has already committed to becoming a creater of methodological
innovations and not just a sophisticated consumer.  Erin's math and
technical abilities are extraordinarily strong.  

Erin's research has allowed her to study a variety of substantial
topics using an array of methodological approaches.  Currently she is
conducting a study of the effect of political debates on mass opinion
of candidates and on vote intention.  The study is based on the
rolling cross section two panel study conducted during the 1988
Canadian National Election Study, and employs a genetic matching
method to attempt to non-parametrically determine an estimate of the
effect of a prominent debate on voter opinions.

More generally, Erin is taking a creative and innovative
methodological approach to address an important question: can survey
research be used to make causal inferences, and if so, how?  This
issue confronts the NSF funded National Election Study and other
academic surveys.  And Erin has the skills to make a significant
contribution in providing some answers to this pressing research
question.

Previously, as an undergraduate, Erin worked with Prof. Mike Alvarez
at the California Institute of Technology, where she completed two
major projects. The first project attempted to determine the
unintentional residual vote rate caused by machine error in modern
voting technologies. The act of casting a residual vote can be a
conscious or unconscious decision, so to properly determine the
accuracy of a voting technology, so she focused on separating the
intentional and unintentional factors.  After employing a
non-parametric bootstrap method using the California Volume Testing
Program data, she found that voting technologies employed in
California elections could contribute up to a large number of
invalidated votes not being remedied.

The second project with Prof. Alvarez explored the commonly held
belief that people in the military are more likely to be
Republican. First, she showed that there are significant differences
between many of the demographic characteristics of enlisted personnel
and their officer counterparts, most notably that enlisted personnel
are more likely to be less educated, black, and female.  In the next
step of the analysis, she showed, employing a probit model, that many
of these same characteristics, which correlate to higher probabilities
of being enlisted, also indicate a higher probability of
self-identifying as Democrat, including race, gender, and rank.
Ultimately, she concluded that inferences cannot be drawn on the full
population based on studies of officers, as has often been done,
because the officers are not a representative sample of the whole
military.

Erin's intellectual capacity and methodological training make her one
of the most promising young methods scholars in the country.  I recommend Erin Hartman without hesitation.

I have known David for about a year.  He transferred into our program from Florida State University.  I am thrilled that David is part of our program because he exemplifies all the traits that an ideal graduate student should have.  He is very bright, hard working, motivated, engaged, conscientious, thoughtful, and friendly (to name a few of his many good traits).

David is extremely self-motivated and I have no doubt that he will be one of the most successful graduate students we have or will have in our program.  He is a bit early in developing his dissertation, but he is very innovative and has incorporated many interesting ideas into his proposal already.  I do not know if other applicants are perhaps further along on their projects or if this is a consideration, but if so, I would urge you not to let this be a factor in considering David‚??s application.

David has taken a number of methods or methods-related courses.  He took the statistics sequence at Florida State as well as the game theory sequence (2 courses).  At Illinois, we offer many advanced courses through the ITV program, and David has taken courses in time series, HLM, event history, and Bayesian statistics.  He also took Luc Anselin‚??s course on spatial econometrics.  At ICPSR, he took the maximum likelihood and advanced maximum likelihood course as well as a Bayesian statistics and longitudinal analysis course.  He also took a nonlinear dynamics courses in the Physics department here as well as multivariate Calculus in the Math department.  David is very serious about his training as a social scientist and attending the Polmeth meetings would be ideal in helping him bringing a lot of his training together.

I have absolutely no reservations in highly recommending that David be invited to the summer meetings.  He will undoubtedly be a very serious student and will benefit immensely.  I urge you to allow David to be part of the program this year.  We have some other students who would also enjoy attending the meetings this summer, but the two particular students we have who are most serious about studying methods and engaging with the methods community are David Hendry and Aya Kachi.

Political Methodology conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan. As a first
year graduate student at the Univeristy of California, Berkeley, she
has sought to develop her abilities in quantitative methods by taking
classes in causal inference and formal modeling. She has a high
aptitude for quantitative analysis and I am confident her future
research on American politics will be innovative and rigorous.

Adrienne has been a student in two of my courses offered through the
Political Science Department. The courses form a two-part sequence on
the foundations of causal inference. As her professor, I have had an
opportunity to observe Adrienne's strong work ethic and capacity to
master difficult statistical concepts. The class requires students to
complete a demanding research project using extant data on a topic of
their choosing. Adrienne worked with a fellow student on a paper that
replicated LaLonde's analysis of non-experimental methods using data
from the Tennessee STAR experiment on class size reduction. The paper
shows promise and creativity and has the potential to be published.

I think her interest in this topic typifies her personal aspiration to
conduct high quality, objective research relevant politics and public
policy.  Before coming to Berkeley to enter our political science
program with a specialization in quantitative analysis, Adrienne
received a master's in public policy at the University of
Michigan. There she completed a paper with fellow students that looked
at the impact on federal compensatory aid for public schools on
student achievement using a regression discontinuity approach. The
experience convinced her of the importance of learning more about
quantitative methods and causal inference and bringing these tools to
bear on the analysis of American politics.

I enjoyed having Adrienne in my classes.  During office hours we often
discussed extended applications of course material and the challenges
of conducting natural experiments. Based on her intellect,
quantitative proficiency, and engagement, I expect Adrienne will make
a valuable contribution to this year's conference and I highly
recommend her for the program.

Box 4925, Berkeley,CA 94704-0925","510-517-1748","","iris_hui@berkeley.edu","","","","","","","","1","1","1","","","","","","","I am writing to unreservedly support Iris Hui's application to the
2008 Summer Methods Meeting. In my course and through her own diverse
research, Iris has shown excellent promise as a quantitative
researcher. Attending the Summer Methods Meeting would be an excellent
opportunity for her to receive feedback on her research, as well as
get exposure to a likeminded community of scholars.

Iris's research interests lie in the intersection between spatial
statistics and causal inference. She has a keen interest in
incorporating advances in Geographical Information Science (GIS) and
spatial statistics in improving causal inference in political science.
Iris will know more about spatial statistics than anyone else in the
room at PolMeth with the exception of Wendy Tam Cho.  Iris has
spearheaded initiatives to promote spatial applications in social
sciences. She organized panels in the American Political Science
Association and American Association of Geographers, as well as an
interdisciplinary seminar at Berkeley that aim to advance spatial
methodology.

Her researches also contribute to methodological innovation. She
presented a paper with Prof. Henry Brady in the 2006 Political
Methodology Meeting, titled ""Is It Worth Going Extra Mile to Improve
Causal Inference?"" which develops a new geographic matching design to
examine voting irregularity.  She has been working on projects that
develop general solution to many applications in political
science. Her recent project (which is submitted as a poster proposal
for this meeting) offers an elegant solution to handle data from
different levels of geography. For example, analysts who are
interested in vote choice may have obtained electoral returns at the
precinct level. Analysts would desire to bring in Census demographic
characteristics to account for the heterogeneity in the
environment. Since precinct and Census boundary do not align
perfectly, analysts often have no easy way to append Census
characteristics to precincts. Using principal curve and kriging, Iris
models variation in the contextual environment with a series of pseudo
propensity scores and integrates them in matching. Her solution not
only allows analysts to incorporate data from different levels of
geography to reduce unobserved heterogeneity, it also significantly
improves the speed of matching algorithm.

Her other project employs advances in GIS to better define
neighborhood. Current literature employs fixed and arbitrarily defined
Census geography as a proxy for neighborhood. Using buffer and spatial
interpolation weighed by the inverse of physical proximity, her
technique breaks from the convention and allows analysts to create
unique neighborhood/context for each observation based on actual
traffic distance. This new methodological advancement creates more
precise contextual measures that allow scholars to pursue substantive
studies to examine contextual effect on political behavior.  Iris's
expertise on spatial statistics also leads her to revisit many
political science topics from a new perspective. Her dissertation
project revisits the ""red-and-blue"" debates and questions how does the
increasingly uneven spatial distribution of income and religiosity
lead to polarization in voting preferences.  As a proud graduate of
the Political Science Honors Program, Iris's intellectual journey
began with her undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor. Her unique background and training would make her a
valuable participant of the Methodology meeting.

Yukari has taken five courses in statistical methods, including three with me.  In addition to courses on linear models and MLE, she has taken courses covering Bayesian methods, parallel programming, ideal point estimation, nonparametric smoothing, bootstrapping, and spatial autoregression.  She has performed very well in those courses. Although her dissertation research is still in its early stages, I know she intends to apply fairly sophisticated statistical methods (relative to much of the field) in her dissertation -- for example, markov transition models and structural estimation of games.

In terms of technical abilities, I would place Yukari in the top 20%-25% of all students attending the summer methods meeting.  She's not at the very top, but she's clearly well within the upper quartile.  Given her interests, abilities, and the methods group's recent interest in ""diversification,"" I would enthusiastically recommend that Yukari be accepted for the conference.  In fact, if the methods group cannot fund her attendance, I would be happy to.

I am writing to recommend that Aya Kachi be invited to the Political Methodology meetings.  Aya comes to Illinois‚??s Ph.D program from Duke University where she obtained her M.A. in Economics.  There, she completed some Ph.D coursework in Economics as well as five Ph.D courses in Political Science.  Her interests, even while in Economics at Duke, have been more consistent with Political Science.  Her Master‚??s project analyzed the patterns and the key factors of economic development in autocracies.  In the project, she formed a game-theoretic model of the dynamics of political regime transition and economic development simultaneously. 

Aya has leapt into our program with great excitement and has impressed everyone with her keen insights and strong skills.  She was simply amazing in our quantitative courses.  In addition to our sequence and all her previous training at Duke, she has also taken Charles Franklin‚??s maximum likelihood course (ICPSR), advanced game theory, and event history analysis with Jan Box-Steffensmeier (through our ITV program).

For her dissertation, she plans to study regime transition and political networking under authoritarianism.  The project focuses on revolution and regime transition under authoritarianism. This study asks why revolutions occur.  Why do some revolts successfully lead to regime transitions?  The puzzle is how opponents of the regime overcome the collective action problem.  Various explanations have been provided in the existing literature of democratization; however, these studies typically ignore the dynamics that lead to the emergence of revolts, which in her conceptualization are networks resulting from individuals‚?? efforts to find secret allies.  Here she utilizes social network analysis to conceptualize social movements as networks of the repressed who hope for regime transition and define ‚??successful‚?ù revolution (that leads to regime transition) as a network that reaches a critical mass without being suppressed by the incumbent government.  She also plans to use agent based modeling to understand the workings of social networks under autocracy and test the hypotheses generated by the ABM with real world data (the macro-level data in the short-run, and the actual micro-level network data in the long-run, from the Eastern European countries.) 

I have no doubt that Aya will emerge as a great scholar.  There are not many visible female graduate students in the polmeth group, but I firmly believe that Aya will add to the small group of distinguished female scholars.  She does first-rate work, is extremely hard working, and has the skills to really excel in this field.  She attended the polmeth meetings for the first time last year and won the best poster prize.  Chris Achen was so impressed with her that he invited her to spend the year at Princeton this year, where is now a visiting student research collaborator.  Burt Monroe has already invited Aya to give a talk at Penn State in his new ‚??New Faces in Political Methodology Conference.‚?ù

Illinois has two students who rise to the top in our methods program.  Aya is clearly one of them.  The other is David Hendry.  We have other students who would benefit from attending the meetings, but Aya and David are our most serious methods scholars, and would contribute to and benefit most from attending the meetings.

Ozan is currently in his third year of graduate training at the University of Maryland. He is widely regarded among the faculty as our most promising student, especially with respect to his methodological skills.  He is exactly the type of student the Society should invite ‚?? he is well trained, productive, has a thirst for expanding his knowledge base and skill set, will contribute to the dialogue, is on track to contribute in both methodology and his substantive area, will benefit immensely from exposure to the latest research, and is someone who will be a regular at the meetings as a faculty member. 

Earlier this academic year, Ozan earned a grade of distinction (our highest grade) on his minor in Methods comprehensive exam, and on his major in American Politics exam scored just shy of distinction.  The latter accomplishment is especially impressive as when he came to the program from Turkey he had no background in American Politics.  I was on both grading committees and was thoroughly impressed with his performance.  At the time I graded Ozan‚??s Methods exam in August I knew him only through our conversations during my interview the previous Fall and several email exchanges.  As part of my comments to the chair of the grading committee I noted that given the depth and breadth of his knowledge, as demonstrated on the exam, that Ozan was someone I hoped I would have the opportunity to work with as a co-author.  I am happy to report that Ozan and I have begun work on a paper investigating the sensitivity of predictions from limited dependent variable models to the approach used to calculate the predictions.  Our conversations about the work show that he has a sophisticated understanding of the issues and his work with the data has revealed his ability to connect theory to practice.  We have a number of interesting results and have submitted a proposal to present this work as a poster at the 2008 Meeting.  

Ozan has taken a variety of quantitative methods courses at ICPSR, has served as a TA for at ICPSR, and will again TA at ICPSR this year.  Given that ICPSR faculty often bring their own TAs, landing a TA position is further evidence of his outstanding abilities.  That he will be a TA at ICPSR during the time of the 2008 Meeting in Ann Arbor is also relevant; Ozan can be invited with little cost to the Society as he will not need funds for travel or lodging.  Given his outstanding qualifications I strongly recommend that the Society pay for his registration fee but I will gladly provide the funds if the Society is unable to do so.  

I should also note that Ozan has a perfect 4.0 GPA and is on schedule to defend his prospectus by the end of this semester.  While he is just in his third year in the Ph.D. program he is lead author on a paper with Geoff Layman and Ric Uslaner that received a revise and resubmit from the Journal of Politics; the revised version is currently under review. 

I am completely confident that Ozan will contribute significantly to the 2008 Meeting and hope that you grant his request to attend.  If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me at mhanmer@gvpt.umd.edu or 301-405-7379.

Sincerely,

Mike

I strongly support Gabriel's request, and urge that he be invited to participate in the summer meetings.

Gabriel is one of the very best methods graduate students I've had --- and for that matter, one of the very best I've seen since myself attending the summer meetings as a grad student in the early 1990's.  

At this early point in his career (he is in his third year at Caltech), Gabriel has mastered most of the cutting-edge statistical methods:  maximum likelihood, Bayesian estimation, non-parametric models, and hierarchical modeling.  He has a handful of fantastic papers under review, and a selection of even better papers in the works.  Importantly, much of his work to date uses data from South America, which demonstrates substantive breadth as well as methodological sophistication.  

In sum, Gabriel is quite likely to be a star in the field of political methodology when he hits the job market in the near future.  He will benefit enormously by having the opportunity to meet his graduate student peers; he will also learn a great deal from the wonderful faculty who will be in attendance this summer.  I urge you to invite him to the conference this summer.

I say ""technical"" because Jeremy has his feet squarely in both statistical and formal theory camps.  His technical chops in both are excellent.  

Jeremy has taken at least five courses in statistical methods, including three with me.  In addition to courses on linear models and MLE, he has taken courses on computational methods, Bayesian methods, and a course in advanced topics, which covered parallel programming, ideal point estimation, nonparametric smoothing, bootstrapping, and other areas.  In the courses he took with me, Jeremy was always one of the top two students in the class.  He is also highly regarded by our formal theorists.

Jeremy's proposed paper examines state resolve in crisis bargaining.  He has constructed a formal bargaining model, specified the uncertainty on the part of the players and statistician, and derived the structural estimator for that model.  It is a terrific combination of game theory and statistical estimation.  Jeremy is able to show (empirically) that developed democratic states are more resolved during war.  This paper is part of a larger dissertation project, where Jeremy is interested in better modeling (statistically) unobservable concepts in IR.

Jeremy will likely go on the methods market.  The only question is whether he will be lured onto the formal theory market instead.  He's at a point in his graduate career where he needs to make some tough decisions.  I am trying to convince him that he should pursue methods over formal theory.  I would place Jeremy in the top 2%-4% of all students attending the summer methods meeting.  Like his peer, Adam Ramey, he's really terrific and should be a definite admit.

I am writing to express extremely strong support for Mike Kellermann's
application to the 2008 summer methods meeting. I have known Mike for
about 4 and a half years now and I know him well. Let me go directly
to the bottom line-- Mike is the strongest graduate student in the
Harvard Government Department. He is among the top two or three
graduate students who will be applying to the 2007 summer meeting. He
should *absolutely* be allowed to attend. 

I have had Mike in two classes-- one an introductory regression class
and the other a much more advanced Bayesian inference class. Mike was
easily the top student in both classes. This is all the more
impressive given that the Bayesian inference course had Ph.D.
students from Harvard Statistics and MIT Cognitive Science in the
class. Mike grasps things very quickly, has excellent mathematical
skills and mathematical maturity, and really cares deeply about the
substantive side of political science. 

Mike's dissertation is a comparative project that makes use of formal
theory and quantitative empirical evidence to gain traction on the
important issue of party formation and party development. I have no
doubt that this will be an important contribution to comparative
politics and will likely also provide advances in applied formal
theory and quantitative methodology. 

Mike also served as a TF (aka TA) for me. He did a stellar job. He
was extremely well organized, hardworking, and generous with his
time. His teaching evaluations were superb (4.71 on a 1-5 scale). I
couldn't ask for a better TF. He did such a good job that I persuaded him 
to serve as a TF for me again this semester.  He is doing a superb job. 

As a second year student Mike won the graduate student poster prize
at the summer methods meeting. I believe he is the youngest student to ever win the prize. 

If this isn't enough, Mike is also a tremendously decent person and a
genuinely nice guy.  I don't say this about everyone I write letters for. 

Mike gets my highest recommendation. He should definitely be allowed
to attend the meeting this year.  In case issues of equity arise, it should be noted that Mike was not allowed to attend last year's meeting-- apparently b/c Harvard students on faculty papers counted against the per school graduate student limit. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of additional
assistance.

His primary adviser to date has been Walter Mebane (who recently moved from Cornell to Michigan), and Holger came to me highly recommended by Walter.

Holger is a very smart person who does clever work.  The paper of his that I know best is an analysis of the effect of West German media on the attitudes of East Germans prior to the fall of communism.  Holger poses the question, did exposure to western media make East Germans dislike their own regime or did it  have the opposite effect?  This is a very interesting question for both academic and policy reason (does it matter if, say, Chinese citizens can see Western television?) but it is difficult to study because of an inherent self-selection problem: people choose the media outlets to which they are exposed.  Holger and his co-author come up with a nice matching estimator for this problem, and result is really neat.  Holger argues that West German media had a placating effect on East Germans and did not appear to make them envy the West and thus revolt.

Holger is a very skeptical consumer of political science, and this should be considered an excellent character trait.  He is very well-trained, definitely more so compared to the typical graduate student who attends the methods meeting.  Holger's methods interests are a product of Walter's, and he is most skilled at working with matching.  This certainly reflects a common movement within the discipline.

I strongly endorse Holger's application to come to the methods meeting.  The discipline would benefit if everyone in it were as careful as Holger is, and I am optimistic for his chances in the profession.

The most significant weakness that Holger has is that he currently falls between two subfields: methodology and comparative politics.  This is an issue that Holger is working on, and the good news is that fit is easier to modify than are creativity and aptitude.  Insofar as Holger is strong in the latter two categories, I think he will figure out the fit problem in the next year or two.

I very much hope that you accept Holger's application, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about him.

I know Georgia well, as she took two courses from me, worked as a research assistant, and worked with me on a paper that we published with another graduate student in Political Analysis.  She has done an excellent job in graduate school and is already being recognized for the quality of her work, having won the POP/Party Politics Award, which honors the best paper presented on a Political Organizations and Parties at the recent APSA annual meetings.  Her dissertation is on an extremely important topic, she‚??s done an impressive job with it, and she‚??s posed to write an important book on how the internal organization of political parties affects their relationships with voters.  Her application deserves careful consideration for any position in political behavior, the comparative politics of advanced democracies, or statistical methods.

Georgia has a very interesting topic for her dissertation.  One of the most significant areas of inquiry in the past 25 years in political science has been the study of institutions, and a vast literature has obviously developed to show how institutional arrangements for making democratic decisions ‚?? legislative rules, electoral laws, etc. ‚?? shape behavior and outcomes.  In the study of parliamentary democracies, the institutional literature typically treats political parties as the unit of analysis.  That is, the literature seeks to explain how ‚??parties‚?ù react to their institutional context (such as in their coalition formation decisions, their electoral strategies, or their ability to represent voters).  But if we believe that political actors respond to the institutional context in which they are embedded, then to understand ‚??party behavior,‚?ù we need to consider the institutional arrangements that govern party decision-making.  That is, we need to do ‚??institutional political science‚?ù at the level of political party.  Georgia‚??s dissertation does exactly this.

In so doing, Georgia also seeks to move the field of political behavior in a new direction.   Until very recently, with the advent of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems survey, behavioral research was more or less ‚??institution-free.‚?ù  That is, there simply was very little possibility of examining how institutions affect the behavior of citizens (as measured by surveys).  Now, with the possibilities created by the CSES, we are beginning to see interesting comparative behavioral research with a focus on institutions.  But to this point, such research has focused almost exclusively on national-level institutions, such as electoral laws.  Georgia seeks to push this institutional research down one level, by focusing on the effects of institutions within parties.

The foundation of Georgia‚??s empirical work is an impressive data set she has assembled on party decision-making structures from 66 parties in 20 countries.  This was an enormous task that was accomplished by acquiring party ‚??constitutions‚?ù (and often having them translated), and interviewing party operatives, usually in person, and often with an interpreter.  The result is detailed information on a wide range of party decision rules.  I have never seen a ‚??political behavior‚?ù scholar in comparative politics go to such lengths to acquire macro data across such a wide range of countries, and Georgia‚??s efforts speak loudly about her willingness to roll up her sleeves and do the very hard work it takes to bring new data to bear on important political science questions.

Decentralization has been the central emphasis in Georgia‚??s existing research on party organization.  Parties can be organized hierarchically, with little power to rank and file members, or they can be more decentralized, with more power to the rank and file.  Institutions relating to candidate selection, party finances, and the representation of different geographic groups, among others, influence the level of decentralization.  Such decentralization should in turn affect party strategies for competing for votes, party efforts to mobilize members, and the ability of parties to maintain a unified position for voters.  Georgia seeks to sort out how these different pieces fit together.

In one of her chapters, Georgia explores how decentralization affects the propensity of individuals to be politically active (by volunteering for political parties or by attempting to persuade others about which candidates they should support).  Focusing specifically on decentralization in candidate selection, she points out that there are conflicting expectations about whether party decentralization should lead to more or less mobilization by individuals.  On one hand, decentralization provides party members with incentives to mobilize voters, because the members have chosen the candidates and thus may feel a stronger stake in getting them elected.  On the other hand, decentralization may cause conflict within parties ‚?? in part through the nomination of local candidates who are not strong supporters of national party policy ‚?? which can demobilize voters.  Using her data on candidate selection processes, Georgia explores empirically which of these two effects is strongest.  She finds that in fact decentralization harms political participation, and speculates that this may be due largely to the relationship between decentralization and heterogeneity of parties.  This causal link is something that she is currently exploring, as is the interaction of decentralization with electoral laws.

In another chapter of her dissertation, Georgia examines the effect of party heterogeneity ‚?? or low party cohesion within parties ‚?? on vote choice.  She develops a simple decision-theoretic framework to argue that this effect should depend fundamentally on the spatial location of the party relative to the voter.  If a party is close to the voter (in spatial terms), then heterogeneity within the party will decrease the likelihood that the voter will support the party (because the heterogeneity may could cause the voter to perceive the median location to more distant than it actually is).  By contrast, if a party is relatively distant from the voter, heterogeneity may help the party attract the voter's support (because the heterogeneity may cause the party to appear closer than it actually is).   

In a three-level statistical model (where the levels are individual, party and country), Georgia finds robust support for her argument.  Using a variety of measures of spatial locations and party heterogeneity, and controlling for a range of individual factors that affect vote choice (including party identification), she finds that the effect of heterogeneity on vote choice is negative for parties that are close to a voter, and is positive for parties that are distant from the voter.  Or, put differently, the effect of spatial distance on vote choice is strong when parties are homogeneous, and is much weaker when parties are heterogeneous.   This is an important result that should have significant implications for both theoretical and empirical research on party competition and voting.

Georgia is continuing to work on other chapters, including a chapter on how party institutions affect representation (e.g., congruence between citizen and party preferences), and on the causes of party heterogeneity.  The dissertation will also include, of course, a very nice and useful description of how party organizations differ across parties in these 20 democracies.  I feel Georgia will be able to pull all this together to make a very original contribution to the study of political parties and elections.

Although her dissertation is shaping up to make an excellent contribution, perhaps Georgia‚??s finest work to date is a paper she wrote on estimating voter preferences in a district (or state) from aggregate vote returns.  The standard practice in the study of U.S. politics, for instance, is to use the difference between Republican and Democratic presidential vote shares in a state to characterize the ideology of the state.  Such state ideology scores have been used in a wide variety of studies, including prominent studies of political representation.  Georgia‚??s paper shows that this approach is flawed, resulting in misleading characterizations of district (or state) ideology.  The problem with the approach is that it relies on the assumption that the distribution in each state is the same.  If voter distributions (and specifically the variances of these distributions) varies across states, then using vote shares will lead to the wrong result.  She proposes an alternative method for estimating district ideal points, and describes implementation procedures using both a frequentist and a Bayesian approach.  Using simulated data, she demonstrates that her approach is superior to the ‚??vote proportions‚?ù approach.  And using real data, she shows that the differences between her approach and the standard approach is substantively significant.  This paper makes a very nice contribution, and it should be publishable in a major journal.  I suspect her measure will receive a lot of attention, and that it will result in the re-analysis of a number of major topics in American politics.  And as Georgia notes, the approach is also adaptable to multi-party elections in systems other than the U.S.  It‚??s a very impressive achievement.

This paper, where Georgia offers formal mathematical proofs, develops her own measure of district ideology, and uses Bayesian methods to estimate the district ideal points, demonstrates Georgia‚??s interest and ability in statistical methods.  She has also developed a strong interest in multi-level models, which she employs nicely in her dissertation.  Although others on her committee can speak better to her mastery of these techniques than can I, she definitely has a stronger command of statistical methods than do most students of comparative political behavior.

Georgia is also a friendly, generous, open and engaged.  She would make valuable contributions to the intellectual environment in any department.  I urge you to consider her application very carefully. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

Dear Members of the Selection Committee, 

Yong-Kyun Kim has applied to attend the 2008 Summer Meeting of the
Society for Political Methodology, and I would like to support his application strongly.  I have known Yong-Kyun since he started his graduate studies in our department.  In the past three years, after he had finished his mandatory course work, he has pursued further training in methods and has acquired a very strong background.  He started out with an interest in comparative politics, my area of expertise, but then shifted his interests to international political economy.  Accordingly, Professor Layna Mosley and I are co-chairing his dissertation. 

Yong-Kyun chose to write three related essays for his dissertation, all dealing with international capital markets and domestic politics.  The first one explains the risk of sovereign default in democracies.  He argues that governments in societies with high income inequality are more likely to default on their foreign debt because default serves as a form of redistributive policy.  He combines a game-theoretic model with an econometric analysis to test his hypothesis, and his results support his argument.  What is innovative is his use of a model of strategic selection to explain which kinds of creditors are likely to receive loans to begin with, and which ones then are likely to default.  His second essay examines the hypothesis that competition for foreign investment drives down social expenditures in developing countries.  He argues that there is no such effect across the board, but that one has to look at social expenditures in competing countries.  In order to test this hypothesis, he is developing a new measure of competitive distance to other countries.  The final essay will evaluate the claim that international investment treaties enhance capital flows to the developing countries that sign them.

Yong would like to give a poster presentation at your meetings on ‚??Regime Type and Heavy Indebtedness: Quantile Regression Analysis.‚?ù  It is an innovative attempt to go beyond ordinary regression analysis and adapt the model building strategy to the theory.  I am convinced he would benefit greatly from feedback to be received at the meetings, and his contribution would be of interest to others. 

Sincerely,

It is my great pleasure to write this letter in support of Jonathan Kropko‚??s application to present a poster at the 2008 Summer Methods meeting.  I have known Jon since my arrival at UNC 2 years ago.  Since then, Jon has served as my TA for our second-semester graduate statistics course, I served on his Methods prelim committee, and I have regularly talked with him about his research interests.  I also observed his work as the Methods TA in our first-semester course where he took primary responsibility for the foundational mathematics instruction/review over the course of that semester.  In short, I know Jon and his work very well and feel very comfortable writing this letter.  Simply put, Jon is one of the three strongest students in methods that I have worked with at all or taught in a methods course during my 12 years in the business.  I recommend him to you very highly.

The poster Jon proposes to present at the Summer meeting tackles a potential problem with the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) models to the study of political processes.  Jon notes that IRT makes the assumption that, once common factors are extracted, the items being analyzed are independent of each other.  Jon suggests that this assumption may be untenable in numerous situations in political science when IRT is applied, including the analysis of roll call votes.  Importantly, Jon‚??s preliminary work suggests that violation of this assumption leads to bias in the estimation process, which can obviously lead scholars to reach mistaken conclusions/interpretations of the processes under study.  Jon‚??s poster will proceed by explicating the independence assumption, showing how it may be violated frequently, demonstrating the bias that results and its magnitude under a range of circumstances, and offering a fix for the problem.  While his work is preliminary at this point, it is quite promising.  If it holds, it stands to be quite influential as IRT is increasingly making inroads in several subfields of political science.

Jon is extremely well positioned to execute this project.  He came to us after completing his undergraduate major in mathematics at Ohio State and has worked extremely hard to mix that training with graduate-level training in statistics and modeling.  As our methods TA, and as a statistical consultant at UNC‚??s Odum Institute, Jon has established himself as a leader among his peers and a person to whom faculty turn for advice on highly technical questions.  He has already completed a very strong Masters thesis examining multinomial logit and probit models through an extensive set of simulations that, when published, will likely be quite influential.  The poster he proposes here marks what I think will be his second substantial contribution to the methods field.  In sum, Jon is extremely bright and well trained.  He is also a very pleasant fellow and a treat to have as a student. I highly recommend Jon without reservation for the Summer Methods conference.

Thank you for your consideration.  If you have any questions or require any additional information, please feel free to contact me directly (carsey@unc.edu).

Patrick Lam was highly knowledgeable about political methodology well before he began graduate school. In fact, I employed him as an undergraduate and he operated
as an advanced graduate student. Then, and subsequently as a graduate student, Patrick worked with me on our Zelig project, coding and developing new models
and deconstructing methods others had created but not really documented.

At Harvard, he excelled in my advanced methods class, and has started on what I think will become several important project. Patrick has also been quite entrepreneurial
as for example as the organizer for an informal graduate methods class taken without credit by many of our students. They get together and either teach each other new methods or recruit faculty to teach on specific topics.
Patrick has my strong recommendation. I encourage you to support him.

Steven Lannoo has worked for me on a research project for almost a year now. I would recommend you to accept him on the Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.

Steven is very interested and an excellent student in research methods. He now studies an intensive training programme, Quantitative Analysis for the Social Science at the HUB (University of Brussels). 
He also gives some classes in quantitative research methodology to our second bachelor-students.

When discussing methodology, Steven never loses sight of the relevant theoretical issues that can be addressed with it. At our department, Steven applies his methodological knowledge in the field of social capital research. In this context, he has some interesting and original ideas to deal with the concept of neighbourhoods.  His poster is interesting for everyone dealing with the question how to operationalise geographical units.

I believe that the work of Steven is of very high quality, especially for a graduate student. The way he brings together methodology, theory and research practice will, to my opinion, be an enrichment for the conference.

Sincerely yours,

She has asked me to write on behalf of her application, which I happily do.

Brianna is currently working on a methodological study that began in Jake Bowers‚?? course on matching and that uses unique survey data collected in New Zealand.  In 1993, New Zealand replaced its majority district voting system with proportional representation.  The change was widely publicized, and, by all accounts, garnered the attention of most of the country‚??s citizens.  Brianna has found unique survey data that were collected both before and after passage of the historic institutional change.  The first survey was completed in 1990, the second shortly after the change in electoral system.  Most importantly, several thousand of the respondents first interviewed in 1990 were interviewed again in 1993.  Several thousand additional respondents were interviewed in 1990 but not 1993 and another several thousand were interviewed in 1993 but not 1990.  Brianna is currently trying to match 1990 respondents who were not part of the panel with 1993 respondents who were not part of the panel.  She intends to use propensity scores to do this.  Then she will compare changes in attitudes toward the government and the political parties among the panel respondents with those among the matched respondents.  This will allow her to determine whether matching ‚??works.‚?ù  More correctly, she will try to determine whether some matching techniques work better than others.

In my view, this is a novel use of a unique data set.  She has not completed the analysis, but the results should be interesting in any case.

In the past few years, some of our most outstanding students have attended the SPM summer program.  Dan Pemstein‚??s poster came close to winning the best poster award last summer; Aya Kachi‚??s poster did win.  I cannot say that Brianna is in quite the same league as these two students, who are our two best; but she is not far behind.  I am confident that, if admitted, she will represent the University of Illinois well.

In fact, I expect him to become a regular attendee, both in the remainder of his graduate career and beyond.  I cannot recommend him strongly enough.

	B.J. came to UT with two Master‚??s in political science, the first from Yonsei University in Korea, the second from the University of Washington, and has been doing splendidly here.  For my part, I have had B.J. in two courses, one substantive (comparative political behavior) and one methodological (simultaneous equation models), and have been helping him develop his dissertation proposal since.  His work and interests display an arresting mix of the philosophical, the empirical, and the technical (both statistical and game-theoretic).  

	B.J. may well be the most talented and is almost certainly (at his stage) the best trained of the technically oriented students we have had in my nearly twenty years at UT.  In addition to the usual complement of methods and formal theory courses in our Department and one in Sociology, he has taken five graduate econometrics courses (Probability and Statistics, Econometrics I, Econometrics II, and Advanced Econometrics) in the Economics Department.  He continues tech-ing up‚??learning new models and programming languages.  In particular he has been learning graphical modeling, as background to the nonparametric structural equation modeling he intends doing in his dissertation.  He has also attended the summer program on the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models at Washington University.  All this puts him at a level well above any of our other graduate students I can recall.   

	B.J. has just now whittled down a too-ambitious draft dissertation prospectus into a version I expect him to defend shortly.  The earlier draft blew me away, cogently sketching several interesting, insightful, and technically impressive analyses.  Its only major ‚??weakness‚?ù was that it was ‚??too much.‚?ù  There was enough material to lay the foundations for two or three first-rate dissertations.  As I say, he has now focused on just one of these, but the parings leave him with a well formed agenda for side- and post-dissertation projects.  

	The dissertation concerns ‚??transitional justice‚?ù:  the treatment of former dictators and human rights violators in newly democratic regimes.  It focuses on the effects of transitional justice measures on the mass foundations of democratic consolidation and stability.  B.J. is particularly interested in the effects of ‚??truth‚?ù (viewed as individual recognition of past abuses) on ‚??reconciliation‚?ù (viewed as encompassing political, racial, ethnic, and religious tolerance; support for human rights; and acceptance of the new, democratic institutions).  He is also interested in identifying the conditions under which Truth and Reconciliation Commissions succeed in promoting reconciliation in these various respects.  

	But B.J. has a lot in the works besides the dissertation.  Among the hivings-off from the original proposal are analyses, based on both formal and statistical models, of the factors causing states to adopt the transitional justice measures they do in the first place.  B.J. already has a paper, and some interesting results, on this score, relating the harshness of transitional justice measures to the strength and abusiveness of the former regime and to GDP, among other things.  I expect this work to form the basis of an article or two in the reasonably near term and of his second book in the further future.  

	B.J.‚??s poster proposal, related to his dissertation, is to describe some of his efforts at estimating the effects of transitional justice measures on democratic stability in the presence of what are, in his context, unobservable variables, like relevant aspects of the national culture and observance of the rule of law, that may affect both transitional justice measures and democratic stability.  He uses his own, impressive, cross-national dataset of roughly 5,000 country-year observations pulled together from many different sources.  He estimates graphical causal models and nonparametric structural equations, comparing what he is doing to such more conventional strategies for estimating in the presence of indirect effects as balancing conditioning (including matching) and adjustment conditioning (including regression).  

	B.J. is extremely intelligent, hard-working, highly focused, and well socialized professionally.  He writes clearly and concisely, if not always idiomatically, in English.  He has wide substantive knowledge and a nose for important topics.  He enriches his work with his good knowledge of philosophy.  And, most importantly in the present connection, he has enormous technical strengths.  He is in the process of becoming a methodologist among methodologists.  

	If B.J. were an American, with native English, I‚??d consider him fairly likely to land a job in a top ten or twenty department and become a truly major figure in his fields.  He may do so anyway.  As I say, his original draft dissertation proposal (in its un-narrowed form) contained the seeds of several prime-time projects, and he continues to build on his technical strengths.  I have been learning and am sure I shall continue to learn a lot from him.  I recommend him in the strongest possible terms for the SPM summer conference.","Luskin","Robert","Associate Professor","University of Teaxs at Austin","rcluskin@austin.utexas.edu","650-380-0430","received","5161","Lee","Byung-Jae","","The University of Texas at Austin","bjlee@mail.utexas.edu","(512) 372-9622","approved","9228","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2008-05-05","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","Complete"

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing in support of Naomi Levy's application to participate in the annual meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.  I met Naomi when she enrolled in my research design seminar as a first-year graduate student.  Since then, she was a student in my statistics course, my teaching assistant three times (once in an undergraduate course on political psychology and twice in my graduate statistics course), and my research assistant for one year.  I served on Naomi‚??s oral qualifying examination committee and am Co-Chair of her dissertation committee.  I know her very, very well.

Naomi is one of the most impressive graduate students I have known.  She was clearly the best student in my research design and statistics classes and outperformed all but a few of the 300+ students I have had in those classes over the years. She took the unusual step of selecting methodology in addition to comparative politics as a major field (our students select two major field and one minor field; a minor in methods is common.)  I was not surprised when Naomi performed brilliantly as my graduate-level statistics teaching assistant.  She has absolutely first-rate analytic abilities and methodological skills.  She is also devoted to furthering her skill with and understanding of empirical methods through regular involvement with the Society for Political Methodology.

Naomi‚??s dissertation, Learning National Identity, investigates the role that history education plays in the development of ethnic and state identities among students in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  Of special importance is whether the school curriculum is under the control of a particular ethnic faction and designed to instill a strong sense of identity among students in that group.  Also considered in Naomi‚??s project is how ethnic segregation vs. integration in the schools, and ethnic tensions vs. harmony (relatively speaking) in the surrounding local communities influence how high school students think of their ethnic ingroup, outgroups, and the state.  The project involves both field and survey research, using data gathered by others (from a project on which Naomi served as a research assistant for two years) but also extensive original research.  Specifically, she, herself, fielded a survey in 21 schools in 12 towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 

Naomi‚??s project provides an important and empirically rich glimpse into how the ethnic conflict that once was primarily waged in the region through warfare is now being fought out through the schools.  In the process, it addresses  how the dramatic variations in schooling practices (ranging from strict segregation of ethnic groups, to strict integration, and with intermediate practices like ‚??two schools under one roof‚?ù) and curriculum (promoting one ethnic point of view or another) are influencing how ethnic tensions are evolving or resolving among young people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  The project develops a new set of survey instruments for measuring ethnic and state identity, which I expect other scholars will pick up and use subsequently.  She generates fascinating findings about how curricular efforts to inculcate a strong sense of ethnic identity in the majority group can prove divisive as they also strengthen the minority‚??s ethnic identity.  She is eloquent in identifying the problems that the two states face in trying to generate a sense of attachment to the whole while enabling the preservation of distinct ethnic cultures, and in deriving from her empirical work implications for the two states‚?? futures.  In all, I see Naomi‚??s dissertation as an ambitious and original project, which should launch what I expect to be a remarkable academic career.

In general, Naomi has a mix of characteristics that make her stand out and above the crowd. She is methodologically sophisticated already but seeks to become more so as her career progresses and through the kind of experiences that participation in the PolMeth conference provide.  Her application has my strong and unconditionally support.

Sincerely Yours,

Morgan is a fantastic student, and like many of Caltech's recent graduate students, has developed a strong array of quantitative skills.  His dissertation involves formal modeling of multicandidate competition, and experimental and quasi-experimental testing of his formal model.  He will be a top candidate on the job market this fall, and would benefit greatly if given the opportunity to participate in this summer's meetings.

Morgan has also developed a number of other research projects that are independent of his dissertation work.  One of the more prominent projects is a collaboration between Morgan, Thad Hall (University of Utah), and myself, involving the development and analysis of novel survey approaches for studying election administration and voting technology issues.  Morgan has three forthcoming papers from this project, and at this point, two additional papers in development.  This project demonstrates that he is highly competent when it comes to the development of new survey instruments, as well as the innovative analysis of survey data.

Morgan is also involved in other projects, including studies of post-election audits, voter registration databases, and survey methods for low-incidence populations.  As this wealth of research demonstrates, he is novel young scholar with a wide breadth of substantive and methodological skills.

Finally, Morgan is simply a dynamic and interactive student.  He would be a great asset to the summer methods conference, and I strongly recommend that he be invited to participate.

The proposed presentation for the 2008 meeting develops a hierarchical item-response model with subject-specific covariates on latent ideal point.  Among its novel features, this model allows formal comparison of non-nested models via the Bayes factor.  He includes illustrations from several empirical settings relevant to substantive research in political science. : the US Supreme Court and the European Parliament.

Dear Committee:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Alex Mayer, currently a second-year graduate student in our department.  Alex has submitted a proposal to attend the Summer Meetings.  I am very happy to write this letter as I think Alex is among the top two or three best students with whom I have worked in 13 years of working with graduate students. I have known Alex for about two years during which he has taken two graduate-level research methods classes, one independent readings class, and has worked on an independent study project. We are in the process of working together on a variety of projects (including a proposed poster for the faculty poster session).   The papers we are working on deal with statistical models for ordinal and nonordinal response variables applied to cross-sectional and time-serial data.  In addition to this, Alex has taken the lead in programming an R function for testing the proportional odds assumption in the ordinal logit model.  He is an extremely careful worker and has an eye for interesting problems, nontrivial puzzles.  In addition to the research he is currently conducting with me, he is working closely with two of my colleagues, Bob Huckfeldt and Jim Adams on several promising projects.   He recently presented work with Adams at the 2008 Public Choice meetings.  On his own, Alex has amassed a significant research record in his ‚??earlier life‚?ù as a physics and mathematics student including co-authoring an article in Optical Letters.  It is also worth noting that Alex will serve as a teaching assistant for the MLE 1 and MLE 2 courses at the 2008 ICPSR Summer Methodology Program. 

The poster he has proposed for the graduate student poster session deals with ancillary parameter stability in the reduced rank multinomial logit model (sometimes call the stereotype model).  Anderson (1984) contended this model could, among other things, be used to evaluate ordinality and distinguishability assumptions in ordered and multinomial response variables.  However, the extent to which the ancillary parameters are stable under different model specifications is an issue heretofore unexplored.  Alex proposes to do some Monte Carlo simulations to consider this issue. 

Alex would greatly benefit from attendance at the Political Methodology Meetings.  This Fall he is taking his comprehensive exams in methods and I think exposure to other faculty and graduate students would facilitate his learning.  Further, as methods will most likely be his major field, he needs to start getting his hands ‚??dirty‚?ù in doing work that measure up to this conference‚??s standards.  I hope the committee can consider Alex worthy of being an attendee at this meeting.  He is a friendly, personable student but one who is critical and questioning of methods and models.  In short, he would not be a shrinking violet at these meetings.    

Sincerely,

I write to offer a strong recommendation for James Melton, as a student who can both contribute to and profit from attendance at the methods meetings this summer. James is in the later stages of his graduate-school career, dissertating feverishly.  He has had extraordinary success in winning grants to perform experiments on the effects of party-system traits on voting behaviour (primarily, on turnout).  Although he has done several pilot studies, he has not yet spent the grant money on the main experiments (using paid subjects, not captive students).  He is keen to make sense of some inconsistent results on the effect on turnout of the number of (serious) parties in competition, and his main insight is that ‚??party system‚?ù and ‚??number of parties‚?ù are not synonymous.  Party systems are, of course, characterized by the placement of the competing parties, and also by the parity (or lack thereof) across these parties in support.  James has been seeking feedback and help from his committee here (Kuklinski, Cheibub, Gaines, and Elkins), but he can definitely use some fresh perspectives on both (a) how to structure the experiments and, especially, (b) how to analyze both observational and his experiment data on turnout levels across different party systems.   

Illinois students did not attend methods at all until fairly recently.  In the last half dozen years or so, by contrast, we have sent at least one student each year.  David Darmofal (now at U S Carolina) found the meeting invaluable as he sought help with issues in spatial econometrics for his dissertation, about 4 or 5 years back.  In 2005, Mike Findley (now BYU) and Kwang Teo presented joint work that ultimately became a JOP article.  Last year, Aya Kachi, one of our two star methods students at present, won a prize for her poster.  Dan Pemstein, our other strongest methods person, presented a paper co-authored with James and another student that, I am hopeful, will be published soon.  All of these students reported back very enthusiastically on the conference experience.  I‚??ve not attended the methods meetings myself in many years, mainly because I am almost always in Great Britain in July.  But I know that the meetings are one-of-a-kind as a student experience, both in terms of networking and for the level of attention from faculty.  I am very hopeful, accordingly, that James, who is a solid and creative student with great work habits, will be allocated a spot.  He isn‚??t in the same league as Aya or Dan in terms of his mathematical background or his toolkit at present, but he‚??s almost certainly in more need of smart guidance and assistance with methodological issues in his work.  Thank you for your time and attention.

The idea that official statistics of electricity provision are systematically biased by comparing those figures with the objective ‚??nights at light‚?ù satellite data is an ingenious idea that could produce important information about governments in less developed settings.

I am very happy to write a letter of support for James (Jamie) Monogan‚??s application to present a poster at the 2008 Summer Methods meeting.  I have known Jamie since before my arrival at UNC two years ago.  He participates in a dissertation workshop that I co-lead, I have seen him present his work, and I talk with him regularly about both his substantive and methodological research interests.  In short, I known Jamie quite well and feel well-positioned to write this letter of support.  As I will make clear, I strongly support Jamie‚??s application.  He is an excellent student ‚?? among the strongest students I have worked with in my career ‚?? and I believe the project he proposes for his poster has the potential to be quite important and of broad interest both substantively and to scholars working in several subfields within methods.  Thus, I recommend him very highly.

Jamie‚??s dissertation focuses on the strategic decisions parties make to position themselves for electoral success and how those choices have both short-term and longer-term consequences for a party‚??s chances of winning.  In developing his theory, Jamie turned to the established literature in formal theory regarding parties, elections, and strategic decision-making.  While the existing work has provided for a number of significant advances, Jamie rightly notes that modeling such behavior formally has thus far forced scholars to make trade-offs between tractable models that not be particularly realistic and more complex models that might be more reflective of the real world but are difficult or impossible to solve.  As others have done, Jamie proposes to tackle his problem computationally through simulation.  Specifically, he has developed an approach to estimate utility functions for two parties facing a sequence of election contests, simulate the behavior of those parties under a range of scenarios, and use the results of these simulations to develop empirically testable theoretical propositions.  Jamie has set a path for his research agenda that I think typifies what we generally hope students strive for ‚?? blending a substantive focus on an important with a strong theoretical foundation and an innovative and appropriate empirical approach to test that theory.  Scholars interested in quantitative analysis, computer simulations, and/for formal theory will find his work interesting, and certainly folks within the EITM tradition will see Jaime‚??s matching of theory and method quite compelling.

Importantly, I think Jamie is quite capable of pulling this off.  He is an advanced student in our program, one of our leading methods students, and has exceptional training both in the classroom and through experiences like the EITM summer program.  Jamie currently works as a research assistant/statistical consultant in the Odum Institute here at UNC, and he is sought out regularly as a collaborator and consultant by both faculty and students in our department.  He is also just a wonderful person and a pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend Jamie without reservation.

Thank you for your consideration.  If you have any questions or require any additional information, please feel free to contact me directly (carsey@unc.edu).

Jacob Montgomery, for
Poster Presentation at Political Metholodogy


	I write to recommend Jacob Montgomery as an advanced graduate student in our department, applying to present a poster at the coming Pol Meth meetings.  Jacob has defended his dissertation proposal and is thus well on his way to completion of his doctorate.  I serve as his professor, advisor, chair of his dissertation committee, and co-author.  Jacob is a remarkable student and extremely promising professional social scientist.  He is one of the most interesting combinations of attributes I have advised or otherwise encountered.  He is likely to enter the job market as one of the two or three strongest Ph.D. students I have written for in the last 33 or so years, and that includes placing students at Chicago, Cal Tech, Berkeley, Yale, Stanford, and so on.  He has an interesting mix of skills.  He is deeply interested in elections and studies them in various ways from survey research, through experimentation, to agent-based modeling.  He received a rare NSF doctoral training grant, he has nearly completed his defense and thereby finished getting his M.S. in Statistical Science (a department formerly known as the Institute for Statistics and Decision Sciences here), and he taught me more than any other student I have had.  

	Jacob is everything you would want in a graduate student or junior (or senior) faculty.  He is very bright, of course, ambitious, hard working, and so on.  He is a social scientist but is obviously intrigued by various aspects of technical social science.  Let me give the relevant examples.  I have already mentioned his pending M.S. in statistics.  ISDS/Stat Science is a particularly Bayesian focused unit, and so he has learned an unusual amount of Bayesian related materials for a political scientist.  He and a fellow graduate student have a paper currently in circulation involving Bayesian model averaging, which seeks to move the discipline father than it has gotten in this area to date.  

	Jacob is applying to you with a project that seems almost obviously a winner from the moment he mentions it.  He wants to use the Annenberg survey, so that he has a reasonable density of respondents in congressional districts, and use those data to reexamine representation in the Miller-Stokes, Achen, et al., sort of way, but with a good bit of data leverage and a good bit of statistical leverage to boot.  Further, he hopes to test a portion of the Fenno hypothesis that representation varies across constituencies, in which he is particularly interested in contrasting the push of the general electorate with the pull of activists.
	I am pleased to recommend Jacob Montgomery to you for this poster session.  He will make a strong presentation, and he will be an asset in the rest of the sessions, as well.  I hope you will accept his application.

I have known Clayton Nall since he took my class in advanced political methodology. In that class, he developed a statistical model for city council racial composition
when different sets of groups are competiting for membership on different councils.

This is an excellent paper that subsequently presented at the Midwest conference. I expect a revised version to be published soon. Clayton and I also worked closely together on an analysis of a large randomized health policy experiment in Mexico. He was heavily involved with developing and implementing the methods and models, and at one point worked out the computer technology necessary to reduce a run that would have taken hundreds of processordays
to just two. He‚??s also a coauthor on two of the papers. Clayton is methodologically sophisticated, with a good deal of math and statistics courses under his belt, even though he is primarily a substantively oriented Americanist interested in American political development; it is an excellent combination for all types of empirical projects.
He has been a teaching assistant for three methods classes, including mine where he did exceptionally well. By all accounts, he is an excellent teacher and tutor of
students.

Clayton has also shown remarkable creativity in unearthing new forms of data. He resurrected a 25-year old panel data of Air Force veterans that directly measures many variables that prior scholars on the same subject have only hypothesized about.

He‚??s also done the same in several other areas. Clayton has my very strong recommendation. Please let me know if I can provide any addition information.

Brendan Nyhan

	I am extremely pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Brendan Nyhan, in support of his application to present a poster this summer.  Brendan is perhaps the most promising young Ph.D. student in American politics to come to Duke in my 19 years here.  He is terrific ‚?? smart, dedicated, enthusiastic, hard-working, ambitious in just the right sense, and a pleasure to be around.  He is the one person I would put my money behind (I guess technically, in some ways, I already have, and will continue to do so), and I recommend to you as strongly as I possibly can.

	Brendan came to Duke from Swarthmore (a double major in Political Science and Economics).  He got what I would hope someone would get at Swarthmore, a very strong liberal arts background.  He combined that with his obvious pleasure in thinking about politics to develop a deep interest in academic life, and in political science as a career in particular.  Part of what made his application so powerful was not only his formal training (with, obviously, an outstanding record) but also his ‚??side‚?ù interest, which led to publication of a book on political spin, to complement a web site (and a good bit of attention in the media, including a column in the Philadelphia Inquirer).  We pulled his application to our graduate program out immediately and put it on track for consideration for the highest award at Duke, the James B. Duke Fellowship.  He won that ‚?? something that a small number of the highest applicants to our program do.  One might think that with his stellar background, he would decide what he was going to do.  Instead, he sought out advice and took it eagerly.  Thus, he is one of a small number whom we have put on a special track for rigorous training in methods (meant generally to include formal modeling as well as statistical methods ‚?? similar to that his co-author, Jacob Montgomery is following, two years later).  It should be no surprise that his years here have been at the same remarkably high level of achievement as all else in his academic background.  The end point of this is that he is in the first set of Ph.D. students admitted to the interdisciplinary certificate program in Quantitative Social Science, and along the way has won a fellowship for this year from the Program in Advanced research in the Social Sciences (‚??PARISS‚?ù) through our relatively new Social Science Research Institute at Duke. 

	In addition to performing at a very high level in the classroom, Brendan has become an essential part of the Aldrich-Rohde research team.  He passed his Ph.D. examinations with distinction (the formal designation ‚?? he does everything with distinction, as you can see), and he has defended his dissertation proposal and is well launched in writing it.  It includes formal modeling, using new, advanced game theory that has just begun to trickle into high-tech economics, it includes sophisticated data analytic methods (in effect ‚??beyond‚?ù statistics, that is doing things that current statistical methods cannot address), but it also includes a lot of substance on the strategic politics behind the growth of potentially scandalous events into full-blown scandals (or, instead, those allowed to recede from public view).

Brendan‚??s proposal is closely related to his thesis (albeit is new from proposal defense).  His thesis examines the politics of what becomes a scandal, and essentially when, why, and how partisan opponents in Congress can take a problem and turn it into an actual scandal.  In this project, he will examine the relationship between two social networks ‚?? one of Members and one of the spread of scandal, and how they interact.  The kind of question he will consider is who is at the center of making the scandal? How far are members of the party leadership from the scandal (what is their Kevin Bacon like number)?  He has been working with a former graduate student here (Michael Tofias) on network models of the Congress, and so this is a natural building point and integration of a substantive problem with a social network.

   	Brendan is a sophisticated and mature scholar who happens to be ‚??only‚?ù still in graduate school.  He is a splendid person and absolutely trustworthy in every way.  I recommend him to you (and everyone else) as strongly and enthusiastically as I can, for this poster and, heck, for just about anything in scholarly areas!

I write to recommend Yoshikuni Ono for the Summer Methods meeting. Yoshi is a promising young scholar who has found a way to integrate a detailed knowledge of Japanese and European politics with advanced training in statistical and formal theoretical inference to draw interesting and potentially important findings about comparative politics. 

I met Yoshi about three years ago, when he took my graduate course in game theory. He did very well in that class. We then kept in contact about his various projects in the months that followed. A year later, he served as a teaching assistant for my ‚??Introduction to American Government‚?ù course (he taught two sections of roughly 25 students each that met twice per week). It was a 300 person class, and Yoshi‚??s devotion to task, personable nature, and reliability were integral to making that effort a success. 

Soon thereafter, the scholar who recruited Yoshi and a few other foreign students to Michigan retired. Yoshi approached me about being his dissertation advisor. I was impressed by his work ethic and with his proposed dissertation. Because I am not an expert in many of the areas that are relevant to his dissertation, I proposed that I could lead in conjunction with an active committee. So, we recruited William Roberts Clark, Anna Gryzmala-Busse and Orit Kedar. Collectively, the four of us work together. I hesitate, however, to say that we guide him. The dissertation is Yoshi‚??s creation. It is a product of careful study of a number of literatures, some really innovative thinking, and a sharp attention to detail.  

The topic of his dissertation is on portfolio allocation as a leadership strategy. The design is clever and creative. In fifteen years, I have not seen an attempt to study this problem that is so ambitious in its scope. And his preliminary findings are remarkable. They have the potential to affect not just the scholarly conventional wisdom about the balance of power in parliamentary democracies, but also more popular views. 

The conventional wisdom on the balance of power in parliamentary democracies, the world‚??s modal form of democracy by a considerable margin, is that the spoils go to the victors. In other words, parties that get higher vote shares in elections and win more seats in parliaments assume power disproportionate to their electoral results. Through a series of careful comparisons that now spans nearly twenty countries, Yoshi has discovered a very different pattern. The largest party actually receives less than a proportional amount of the major political offices (cabinet ministries) in country after country. Perhaps as interesting, this kind of result was anticipated in both theoretical modeling work that he did before gathering the data and by painstaking work on the case of post-election bargaining in Japan. The empirical results are no artifact and have already withstood substantial scrutiny. Alone, they would be sufficient to generate substantial attention to Yoshi‚??s work. But when that attention comes, the depth and rigour of his dissertation project will also provide wisdom about why ‚??the spoils‚?ù aren‚??t going to the victors in the quantities that scholars and others expected. 

In short, the presentation he proposes is part of a very strong project. As his dissertation advisor, some may be tempted to read my claim as hyperbole. To that end let me say this, as much as I might like to, I can take almost no credit for this work. Yoshi built it from the ground up. In every context, Yoshi has been a model of competence and perseverance. I wish that all of my graduate students were more like him. In thinking about Yoshi‚??s future, I think that it is very bright. He will bring value and good cheer to the meeting. 

Sincerely,
Arthur Lupia

Dear Selection Committee Member

Erica L. Owen asked me to support her application to attend this summer‚??s methods meeting in Ann Arbor. Erica took my core graduate course in modeling politics as well as the ITV time series seminar that I team-teach with Janet Box-Steffensmeier. I now serve as her advisor. As a result of working with her in these capacities I have come to know Erica well.

Erica Owen is one of the most promising students in our graduate program. Her intellectual abilities are simply outstanding. She demonstrated this in our time series seminar. In it, she produced some of best‚??if not the best work‚??of the twenty-six students who enrolled (this included students not just from Minnesota but also from Wisconsin, Illinois and Ohio State). Illustrative was her reanalysis of a paper by Clarke and Stewart that originally appeared in 1995 The British Journal of Political Science. By applying multiequation time series methods, Erica showed that the model used by Clarke and Stewart is misspecified, in particular, the model‚??s exogeneity restrictions are not supported by the data. At the same time, Erica illuminated some interesting causal linkages between exchange rate fluctuations, personal expectations, and voting intentions in Britain. This was not just an excellent application of a time series method, Erica‚??s paper was a genuine contribution to scholarship. Her performances in our other courses--in methods, formal theory, and international relations--have been equally stellar. For example, in one course she wrote a powerful critique of attempts by Morrow and others to apply social choice theory and its lessons for democratic decision making to the international system (with its many nondemocratic regimes and autocratic institutions). This was a real tour de force analytically and substantively.  It was because of her outstanding course work that our Department bestowed on Erica the Efimenco Fellowship.   

The methodological training Erica has obtained thus far is exceptional. No student in our program has her range of methodological expertise. This includes social choice and game theory as well as coursework on regression analysis , discrete choice models and MLE, event history analysis,  and time series models. Last summer she attended the EITM program at Washington University-St. Louis. This gave her valuable insights into how to marry her studies of formal theory and statistics. It also should be noted that as an undergraduate at Rochester she earned a degree in economics as well as in political science. Randall Stone was her advisor. She also worked for Gretchen Helmke analyzing data from a World Bank project. It is rare to find a graduate student with such a range of training and experience.

Attending the summer meeting in Ann Arbor will help Erica Owen deepen her understanding of political methodology and realize her tremendous potential as a student of international political economy. As a student beginning the dissertation, it is important for her to hear presentations of high-end methodology and to have her work evaluated by the top people in the field.  Erica is interested in the politics of finance. This area requires exactly the kind of advanced methods that we present and discuss at our summer meetings.

In sum, Erica Owen is an ideal candidate for the summer methods meeting. She has my highest recommendation.

John R. Freeman

Xun Pang is the only current Washington University student who is a
first field student in political methodology.  We have extremely 
high standards and expectation for such students and while a great
many here have methods as a second field, few actually major in 
methodology.  Her concentration is Bayesian time series and she is
interested in applications in political economy.  The paper that I
would expect her to give as a Summer Meeting poster is a Bayesian
time series ordered probit model.  This requires a substantially
customized multigrid MCMC algorithm to estimate and she is now
working on calculating the Bayes Factors, which are nontrivial
to produce.  

Xun comes to us with substantial general mathematics skills and 
she has worked hard while at Washington University to develop her 
statistical knowledge.  Her classes have included standard offerings
in the department as well as outside coursework.  I am particularly
impressed with skills in applying statistical computing to solve
difficult problems.  Her dissertation work, jointly supervised by
myself and Andrew Martin, will apply such technology to understanding
issues in trade policy and global oil supply disruptions in 
particular.  It is important to note that Xun will be on the market
(probably Fall of 2009) AS A METHODOLOGIST.  That is, she is not 
seeking to come to Summer Meeting to polish up her secondary 
credentials to look better as a student in political economy.  I
would be most grateful to see Ms. Pang invited this summer, she is
one of the most promising young methods students I have seen.","Gill","Jeff","Professor/Director","Washington University","jgill@wustl.edu","314-935-9012","received","8026","Gill","Jeff ","Professor/Director","Washington University","jgill@wustl.edu","314-935-9012","approved","9342","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2008-05-07","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","Yes","","","","","","","Complete"

application to the summer methods meeting. I have known Dan since he
was an undergraduate at Washington University---almost 7 years now.  I
think extremely highly of Dan and I absolutely think that he should be
allowed to attend this year's summer meeting. 

I first met Dan when he was an undergraduate computer science /
political science double major at Washington University.  He was
working as an undergraduate RA on some work that Andrew Martin and I
were doing. This work became the Scythe Statistical Library (a C++
library for statistical computing). Dan did such great work on the
project that Andrew and I made him a co-developer on the project and a
co-author on the paper in the Journal of Statistical Software that
describes the features of the Scythe Library. Dan is an *exceptionally
good* programmer. His programming skills are the best that I've ever
seen in a political science graduate student and, quite frankly, his skills in
this area are at least as good as anyone in the political science
faculty ranks. When I have a programming question the first person I
ask is Dan. It is a rare occasion when he doesn't know the answer.

Dan also knows a considerable amount of statistics. He is currently
sitting in on the Bayesian inference class that I teach and he regularly
asks questions that anticipate where we are going. In talking with him
about some of his own work he seems to have a good sense of the
modeling enterprise---what simplifying assumptions are reasonable,
which aspects of reality should be directly modeled, etc. I have every
reason to believe that he will be extremely competitive on the methods
job market when he goes out. 

I have been so impressed with Dan's skills that Gary King and I
brought him out to Harvard as a pre-doc. Here he has been working on
projects that involve the statistical natural language processing. The
work he has done so far has been very good. We are extremely lucky to
have him working with us. 

The paper Dan plans to present as a poster looks at models for
roll-call votes in the European Parliament (EP). The unique institutional
features of the EP create problems for standard roll-call models that
were designed primarily for the US Congress. Dan's project develops
new models for such voting data. This is an important research agenda
that could have large payoffs for students of comparative politics. I
am confident that Dan will make real progress here. 

In summary, Dan is an extremely talented person who would greatly
benefit from attending the summer meeting. I absolutely think that he
should be allowed to attend the meeting.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of additional
assistance. 

Sincerely, 
Kevin Quinn

If there ever was a great bet for being a success in the profession, it‚??s Ellie Powell. As a high school student, she took two of the three classes in the University of Rochester Ph.D. political methodology sequence. She also has considerable experience as a research assistant, coauthor, and scholar.

Ellie took my advanced political methodology class at Harvard and was in the very top group of students. I chose her to lead our math prefresher for incoming graduate
students, and she did an exceptional job of organization, teaching, and writing. The faculty saw the notes she prepared and asked for copies; several suggested that they
be published.

Ellie‚??s dissertation is shaping up to be an important piece of scholarship. She notes that no existing scholarly work has demonstrated the clear effects of money on
congressional decision making, including votes, policies, and promotions. Its also true that the effects of money in other areas of American politics are viewed as enormously powerful by the public, but the best empirical evidence in most areas does not support this view. Ellie shows that everyone has been looking in the wrong place. She shows that the selection of committee and party leaders is enormously influenced by money. Her results are not a 5% tweak on past work; she has a finding that I do not think has been noted before, and the effects are very large. I think this work will get a lot of attention when finished. With the right support, she is very likely to finish next year.

We are working together on a qualitative methods project (somewhat related to Designing Social Inquiry). We‚??ll give our first paper from this project at the APSA conference this year. She has been a terrific collaborator. One other thing. Nothing stops Ellie. She comes in to work every day and pounds on whatever problem is in front her her until it is vanquished. I understand she was hosptialized in college for several months and had four separate surgeries, a month
in intensive care, and three months away from school (she‚??s perfectly healthy now). But you can‚??t find evidence of this on her college transcripts: She didn‚??t miss a semster and got straight As.

Supporting any student is a risk, but this is the kind of risk I‚??d take. Please let me know if I can provide any further information.
Sincerely,
~~

Dear Selection Committee, 

It is our pleasure to write a letter of support for Scott Powell to attend the 2008 Political Methodology Summer Meetings. Scott is currently a third year student in our Ph.D. program and he will have a masters in Economics as well.  His substantive work is in comparative politics and political economy. We have encouraged him to participate in the Political Methodology Conference this year.   

Scott‚??s dissertation represents a fruitful extension of a vibrant research program about the effects of globalization. Rather than focus on broad cross-national generalizations, Scott seeks to understand government responses to globalization in the OECD states by unpacking the politics underlying a specific policy response: the use of active labor market policies (ALMPs) such as job re-training programs. More precisely, the puzzle motivating this research is the apparent under-utilization of ALMPs as effective and efficient responses to global pressures in the OECD states. Given that such policies appear to be ideally suited for dealing with the twin pressures of openness‚??they avoid the costs of protectionism while providing those affected the skills required to succeed in the new economy‚??why do governments not use them more? 

Scott‚??s argument is original and provocative. Counter-intuitively, he suggests that labor unions in advanced industrial democracies have resisted such policies. Why? The basic argument is that labor unions see job re-training as a danger to their very existence. If workers in traditionally union sectors are re-trained, odds are that the new jobs they will take are in sectors that are not already unionized and that, moreover, have typically been resistant to unionization. As jobs shift from the manufacturing sector to more capital-intensive sectors, union presence will shrink, and, with it, so will the influence of labor in politics. Fearing just this scenario, it makes more sense for unions to resist job re-training programs and ALMP measures, and instead fight for protectionist barriers that might preserve their jobs and political influence.

If correct, Powell‚??s argument would provide a fresh perspective on an important and long-standing question, and reveals an analytically sharp mind. His approach empirically is also encouraging. He has received excellent quantitative training at Ohio State with strong performances in all his methods courses, and he has complemented these skills by doing two stints of preliminary fieldwork in Germany and the United Kingdom where he has conducted interviews and archival research.  Scott‚??s work will result in new data that will identify variation in the design, generosity and function of labor market programs in 18 OECD governments, as well as the employment structure of the bureaucracies that implement these policies.  Using this original data set, a quantitative analysis will be performed to evaluate the determinants of structural transformations in unemployment insurance.  Of particular interest are the effects of institutions of welfare state governance and political partisanship. Scott will use both time series and pooled time series cross sectional models.  He is exploring ways to bring into his models spatial heterogeneity. He is exactly the sort of young comparativist who would benefit from exposure to the PolMeth community, and in time he will be able to contribute to our conversations fruitfully too.

Scott is one of our most promising students.  We are excited about the work he is doing at the intersection of methodology and comparative politics, which is why he was chosen as the junior fellow in the Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM).  As part of PRISM, Scott works as a consultant with faculty and graduate students on methods issues that arise in their work.  His breadth of methods training and innovative ideas is what set apart his application for the fellowship.  He has also given PRISM presentations on methods topics and software.  They have been very well received by faculty and graduate students in the social sciences.  

Scott would benefit enormously from participating in the Political Methodology Annual Summer Conference. Attendance at the Political Methodology Meetings at this juncture in his graduate career would be very  valuable and influential on his career trajectory.  

Sincerely,

I think he's a great candidate.  To begin, I've known Robi for about
three years following his admission to our graduate program.  In fact, he is simultaneously pursuing a degree in economics, where he also received excellent
methods training.   In addition to our methods sequence, he's had three courses in micro (one of which essentially was game theory), two in public economics, and four in
econometrics.  In political science, he took two formal theory courses, one of them mine.  In that class I found him to be an extremely perceptive, inquisitive, and intelligent student, quick to notice both logical and substantive gaps in the literature we were studying, including classic work by Calvert, Wittman, Alesina, Ferejohn, and Meltzer and Richard.  He is simply one of the very best graduate students I've encountered.  I directed his masters thesis and I'm now co-directing his dissertation along with David Mustard from the Economics Department who is an expert in applied economics.

     His thesis, which is part of his dissertation, was originally stimulated by an empirical puzzle:  the standard median voter model of taxation suggests there would be much more substantial redistribution than is generally found. To address this finding, he investigated the impact of institutional structure on policy outcomes, starting with the fundamental observation that an institutionally divided electorate will produce different outcomes than do direct elections:  the median of the medians is not, in general, the population median.  He explored this issue using a set of increasingly structured simulations, finding that a key factor throughout was the specific distribution of voter preferences.  The next stage of his project is to map these results into a more targeted analysis of the U.S. Congress to understand its impact on policy outcomes and their deviation from population medians.

     In short, I think Robi is a great candidate for the Methods meeting.  I expect that he will profit greatly from this meeting, and those with whom he interacts will profit as well.

Adam has taken at least five courses in statistical methods, including two with me.  In addition to the usual courses on linear models and MLE, he has taken Bayesian methods and a course in advanced topics, which covered parallel programming, ideal point estimation, nonparametric smoothing, bootstrapping, and other areas.  In the courses he took with me, Adam was always one of the top two students in the class.  My impression is that Adam is generally the top (or one of the top) students in just about every class he takes.

More recently, Adam has taken our advanced methods comprehensive exam, which included defending a paper that makes a methodological contribution.  This is the paper (""Missing in Action"") he is proposing as a poster for the conference.  In this paper, he uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to model NA/DK repsonses in ordinal survey questions.  He uses MCMC to estimate his model, with an application to voter perception of candidate ideology.  His findings contrast with the larger literature, which generally uses listwise deletion in these situations.

Adam will certainly go on the methods market.  I would place him in the top 2%-5% of all students attending the summer methods meeting.  He's really terrific and should be a definite admit.

Mark Ramirez has asked me to recommend him for the methods meeting and I do so enthusiastically.  Mark is, without a doubt, the best graduate student A&M has ever had.  While I have only been here since 2000, I know I can say this because it is the consensus view of the faculty I have talked about it with here.  He is as smart as they come, unbelievably hard working, has shown real aptitude at methods, and asks important theoretically motivated questions.  His talents and work ethic are what lead Paul Kellstedt, Guy Whitten and I to ask Mark to be the editorial assistant for TPM.  He is also a great guy.  He is one of those graduate students that you really enjoy having around and will miss when he leaves.  He is a precisely the kind of student that would benefit from his experience at methods meeting.
Mark showed up at A&M completely prepared for graduate school.  He had taken graduate seminars from Paul Goren (now at the University of Minnesota) and Kim Fridkin while an undergraduate at Arizona State.  I was struck during his recruitment visit here by how intellectually mature and creative he was.  During our chat while he was here he pitched a paper idea to me for an original experiment testing theories of distributive justice and support for political institutions.  After he arrived, I helped him through the institutional review process to get the study approved and double checked some of his question wording, but Mark took the complete responsibility for this paper.  The experiment turned out beautifully, and it is forthcoming at Political Psychology.  A second paper on the dynamics of Congressional approval was just given an R&R at AJPS.  He is also part of two other projects with me under review at APSR and JOP and has other faculty lining up to work with him.  I expect that Mark will have several publications in top journals to his name when he goes on the market.
His performance in seminars has been unparalleled.  He not only reads all of the required and recommended readings for a week, he often reads other work cited in those readings to make sure he fully understands all of the literature.  He is engaged in class, asking the best questions and pushing his fellow students to move beyond petty details and think theoretically.  His writing was good when he arrived.  He has taken gain effort to improve it, asking as many faculty members to read his work as possible.  
His methods skills are also easily the best I have seen here, and I have taught most of the students who have come through here over recently.  Part of this is that Mark gets it.  He knows the importance of sound methods and has taken every class possible at A&M on the topic including two classes in regression (taught using Gujarati and Greene), an experimental methods course, time series, maximum likelihood, hierarchical modeling and game theory.  He spent a summer at ICPSR taking coursework in Bayesian methods and Multidimensional scaling, and attend EITM last year.  
Mark is at an important juncture in his career.  He is beginning the empirical analyses for his dissertation and is looking for that important feedback on the empirics and methods before he goes on the market this fall.  This basic idea for the dissertation centers on the difference in public attitudes about the institutions of government.  His is developing an interesting argument based on attribution theory in psychology to explain both the common and divergent movements in public opinion about the president, congress, and the Supreme Court.  It has the potential to be an important dissertation that will speak to many areas of American politics.

I certainly would support the participation of Tim Reeskens in this Conference. He is already well versed in methods, and a remarkably good graduate student, who is very eager to learn more.

Thus far, his articles have been accepted/published in: International Migration Review, Comparative Political Studies, Social Indicators Research and the Journal of Women, Policy and Politics. A number of his articles have also been published in Dutch language journals (with peer review process) such as Acta Politica, Tijdschrift voor Sociologie, Pedagogische Studi√´n, De Gids op Maatschappelijk Gebied, Internationale Spectator and others. The more sophisticated analyses in these articles (including time-series, multi-level methods, etc...) have been conducted by Tim Reeskens.

Tim's full publication record can be found at: http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/biblio.php?ref=Reeskens&init=T

I do believe such a record is quite exceptional for someone who still has to get his PhD degree, so I do hope that he will be accepted in this conference.

To Whom It May Concern:
 
	It is with great pleasure that I write this letter to enthusiastically endorse Inaki Sagarzazu‚??s application to the 2008 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. He is a brilliant graduate student with a very sophisticated research agenda who will greatly benefit from participating in the 2008 meeting. 

Inaki is without a doubt the smartest graduate student I have ever had. A programmer in his previous life, Inaki has no technical limitations that I am aware of. He can program with ease in C++, Perl, Java, and R among other languages. Inaki is the kind of student that top departments usually seek to recruit and, if it wasn‚??t because family reasons kept him in the Houston area, I have very little doubt he would be today in a top 10 political science department. There is agreement among faculty that Inaki is the best methods student this department has had in years and, last summer, he was assigned the responsibility of teaching our graduate math seminar. 

 I met Inaki two years ago when he attended one of my graduate seminars at the University of Houston. From the first day he proved to be a different kind of student. His participation was highly theoretical and well informed, showing an understanding of the materials well ahead the rest of his classmates. Given his sharp analytical skills, intellectual drive, and his own interest on advanced methods; I invited him to participate in an internal seminar that included four faculty (James Granato, Timothy Hellwigh, Noah Kaplan, and myself) and our two most promising students (Inaki and Anna Mikulska). His participation in the seminar was excellent, and the beginning of two research projects we currently have underway. Shortly after, Maria Victoria Murillo (Columbia) and I, asked Inaki to participate in a NSF funded project on partisan networks. 


Inaki‚??s research is also extremely promising. He is currently setting up the building blocks for an ambitious dissertation that will analyze political dialog in the written media. Using a very large database of Op-Eds in Venezuela (and the US), Inaki is using political discourse as data not only to obtain ideal point estimates of prominent political figures in Venezuela but, more importantly, to understand the nature of political dialog. Inaki‚??s research will seek to further our understanding of the relationship between issue ownership and political engagement. That is, the conditions under which politicians engage (or avoid) dialog.  

Attending the meeting will allow Inaki to interact with professors and graduate students working on related areas and to gather feedback that is critical at this stage of his training. It is with great pleasure, therefore, that I wholeheartedly support Inaki Sagarzazu‚??s application to the 2008 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. If you need further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yoji has taken four courses in statistical methods, including two with me.  In addition to courses on linear models and MLE, he has taken courses covering Bayesian methods, parallel programming, ideal point estimation, nonparametric smoothing, bootstrapping, and other topics.  

Yoji's proposed paper applies methods developed by Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007, Econometrica) for estimating the parameters of a dynamic game -- here, modeling crisis bargaining between countries.  The econometrics of dynamic games is a hot area in economics and should be receiving more attention in political science.  

In terms of raw talent, I would place Yoji in the top 1%-2% of all students attending the summer methods meeting.  He's really that good.  He will likely go on the formal theory and IR markets.  However, like a Diermeier or like Alastair Smith, he will almost certainly make important contributions to political methodology.  Because of that, he should be admitted to the summer conference.

I met Yael three years ago when she transferred to Washington University to continue her PhD.  Yael was one of my best students in the introductory graduate regression course.  She has also served as my teaching assistant for an undergraduate class on comparative party politics.  Consequently, I think I am in an excellent position to recommend her wholeheartedly and without reservations as a competent, motivated, and thorough scholar.

Yael will present a paper we are coauthoring on the consequences of ignoring abstentions in roll-call data analysis.  We argue in this paper that abstentions are extremely common in decision-making bodies around the world, and that the appropriate use of methods to recover ideal points from roll-call datasets‚??such as Nominate and MCMC IRT‚??are based on assumptions about the ignorability of 
abstention-generating mechanisms that may be difficult to meet in practice. We discuss different abstention-generating mechanisms to understand the conditions under which they may be deemed ignorable, and extend the MCMC IRT model so as to incorporate information from abstention patterns into inference about legislators' ideal points.

I am confident that Yael will do a fantastic job presenting this paper to participants in the Society's meeting.  I base this statement on the fact that she already successfully presented a previous version of the paper to an audience of political methodologists at Washington University.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

	Mary is in her third year of UT‚??s Ph.D. program, having come to us from Saint Louis University, from which she graduated summa cum laude, majoring in political science and minoring in Spanish.  At UT, she has maintained those interests, focusing substantively on comparative and on Latin American politics, while adding a thematic focus on mass politics (public opinion, voting, political participation) and a major interest in quantitative methods.    
	 
	Mary is clearly one of the very best of our more than 100 current Ph.D. students.  I judge this from her performance in the substantive and statistical coursework she has taken with me, from her work TA-ing for me, from my conversations with her about her dissertation, and, perhaps above all, from her writing, which, apart from being unusually lucid and graceful, displays a level of intelligence, thought, and mastery of the relevant literatures and analytic techniques that is rare at her (or any) stage.  My opinion is shared by every other UT faculty member with whom I have had any conversation about her.

	At UT, Mary has taken the methodological basics (through regression) with Tse-min Lin, Corrine McConnaughy, and me, then studied maximum likelihood with Lin, the empirical implications of theoretical models with Jim Granato, and longitudinal analysis with Dan Powers (in Sociology).  In addition, she has attended the ICPSR Summer Program the past two summers, studying time-series methods with Genie Baker, models for categorical data with Alfred DeMaris, methods for panel and time-series cross-section data with Greg Wawro, longitudinal analysis with Mike Berbaum, and scaling methods with Bill Jacoby.  The first summer she attended with the aid of a highly competitive Clifford C. Clogg Memorial Scholarship from the ICPSR, and the second with the aid of the inaugural Janet Box-Steffensmeier Scholarship, awarded to a female graduate student to attend the ICPSR Summer Program by the APSA‚??s Political Methodology Section.  

	It is a measure of Mary‚??s growing methodological expertise (not to mention her warm personality and excellent pedagogical skills) that she was chosen to teach the Department‚??s first ‚??math camp‚?ù for incoming graduate students‚??and by all accounts did a bang-up job of it.  She has already been asked to the second edition, this coming summer, as well.  She has also TA‚??ed for the first two courses in our graduate statistics sequence (twice for Tse-Min Lin fir the first course and once each for Corrine McConnaughy and for me for the second course.     

	This second course is about regression models, broadly construed.  The semester is still in progress, but I am extremely pleased and impressed with the job Mary has done.  I have had many outstanding TAs for the graduate statistics courses I have taught here, at Michigan, and at Essex but can‚??t think of any who has done a better job than Mary has done so far.  She holds weekly labs to go over the exercises, provide supplementary (typically background) material I haven‚??t the time to go into in class, and answer questions.  She also fields questions in office hours.  In all respects, she has performed exceptionally well.  

	Mary has passed her comprehensive exams and recently completed a detailed outline of her dissertation proposal, which I expect her to defend in the coming weeks, certainly by the end of this semester.  Since the project is developing nicely, and at a good clip, I also expect her to make rapid progress thereafter.  

	The dissertation will examine candidate-centered voting in new and established democracies.  In this electronic age, the candidates‚?? traits and backgrounds, rather than their policy positions, their party, or the incumbent party‚??s performance in office, appear to be the most important influence on vote choice‚??both in the U.S., where the question has received much scholarly attention, and in the rest of the democratic world, where the research is scarcer, but journalistic accounts suggest that personality also dominates (even in parliamentary systems).  In Mary‚??s home region of Latin America, for example, there has been much recent discussion of the rise of populist leaders √  la Chavez and of ‚??delegative democracy.‚?ù 

	The questions Mary plans to examine concern the variations‚??across both voters and countries‚??in the extent and the nature of this phenomenon.  How much do people vote on the basis of candidate personalities?  On the basis of what traits?  (Leadership?  Empathy?  Affability?  Competence?  Integrity?)   How do the focus on personality and the particular traits attended to vary as a function of the characteristics of the voter, the system, or the circumstances?  What differences would it make if everyone voted entirely on the basis of candidate personality, or of no one did, or people in country X voted as much or as little on that basis as people in country Y?  These are some of the questions Mary will be addressing.  

	They are important questions, from both normative and empirical perspectives.  Normatively, candidate personalities are a distraction from the more central, who-gets-what stuff of politics, and some traits may be more of a distraction than others.  Voters focused more heavily on candidate personalities (and perhaps especially on certain traits) may be likelier to cast votes at odds with their own values and interests.  In the aggregate, electorates composed more heavily of such voters may be likelier to do the same.  Empirically, the role played by voters‚?? reactions to candidates‚?? personalities is vital to understanding why elections turn out the way they do and to the occurrence of phenomena like ‚??delegative democracy.‚?ù

	Mary‚??s data would come, in part or perhaps entirely, from existing surveys, which are plentiful.  There are twenty or so countries from which there are archived national election studies containing measures of the variables she would need.  Funding permitting, however, she will also draw data from her own survey, administered to relative small numbers of respondents (say 100-150) in a small number of countries (2-4, probably including Mexico and Brazil).  

       Mary‚??s proposal for a SPM summer camp presentation falls out from this dissertation project.  She plans on examining the weights Brazilian voters give to candidate personalities versus other considerations in casting their votes and how those weights vary across voters.  She plans on using the data compiled and reported on by Baker, Ames, and Renno in their AJ PS article on ‚??Social Context and Campaign Volatility in New Democracies: Networks and Neighborhoods in Brazil‚??s 2002 Elections.‚?ù  In the interest of maximizing comparability to other countries yet to be looked at, where the number of contenders may vary, she plans to follow the suggestion in the recent Electoral Studies piece by van der Eijk, van der Brug, Kroh, and (Mark) Franklin of modeling electoral utilities rather than discrete vote choice‚??but to substitute candidate feeling thermometers for the probabilities of ever voting for given parties (van der Eijk et al.‚??s suggestion) as the measures of electoral utilities.   

	Of course it is also worth mentioning, in Mary‚??s case, the SPM‚??s laudable interest in promoting the development of more female methodologists.  Mary would both benefit from and contribute to the success of the NSF-funded reception and dinner for ‚??Women in Political Methodology‚?ù that is on this year‚??s schedule.  

	In sum, Mary is on her way to her an excellent career.  She is highly motivated and well-organized, a self-starter who does everything without suggestion or prodding.  She is acquiring the methodological skills to be a methodologist (with at least a small-cap ‚??m‚?ù) and a highly sophisticated practitioner.  I recommend her for this summer‚??s SPM conference in the strongest possible terms.","Luskin","Robert","Associate Professor","University of Texas at Austin","rcluskin@stanford.edu","650-380-0430","received","8527","Moser","Robert","Associate Professor/Graduate Adviser","University of Texas at Austin","rmoser@austin.utexas.edu","512-232-7278","approved","2195","0000-00-00","Accepted","0","Yes","2008-05-31","0000-00-00","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","Yes","","","","","","","Complete"

Dear Graduate Student Selection Committee, 

	I am writing in enthusiastic support of Anand Sokhey‚??s application to attend and present a poster on his research. Anand is one of the top three students I have worked with during my career. 
	
	As a reflection of the high esteem that he is held in at Ohio State, he was chosen to receive the Senior Fellowship in Methodology, which is part of PRISM (Program in Statistical Methodology) at Ohio State.  As part of the PRISM program, he provides consultation to faculty and senior graduate students.  He engages, pushes, and inspires the faculty and graduate students he interacts with to make their work better.  The combination of his ambition and hard work ethic results in very high quality work. Anand has been driven to work to be a broad methodologist.  He has interests and training in multi-level modeling, survival analysis, survey research/questionnaire design, and time series.  

	He is distinguished in the area of methodology by his intuition, which is built upon by connecting similarities across methods. I believe that Anand would get a lot out of the methodology meetings because he makes such connections.  Anand is also an excellent presenter and a participator.  That is, he will engage others at the conference.  By doing so, he will help maintain the vibrancy of the meetings.   

	Anand is one of Ohio State‚??s best students in terms of creativity. He tackles questions in the field of political behavior from a unique angle.  His creativity has captured the attention of various funders (seven separate sources for several different projects).  Thus, he has  collected original survey data for his dissertation.  He has published in Social Science Quarterly, two pieces in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, PS, five published or forthcoming book chapters, and American Journal of Political Science.  He has accomplished all of this as a fourth year graduate student and he will be on the market this fall.

	It is hard to describe in cold prose the sense of excitement and intense energy that Anand brings to his research.  It is his excitement and energy that will result in his contribution to the meeting.  It is clear that graduate students benefit immensely from attending.  Anand will also be one of them that benefits, but also substantially contributes. 

Sincerely,

I endorse Young Hoon Song‚??s application for Participation in the 2008 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. He is an excellent candidate for participation. Mr. Song has developed strong interests in both formal theoretical choice models and the statistical testing of these models. His substantive area of interest is international relations. One of his current projects involves an innovative use of Cox Competing Risk model in an area of IR that has favored the use of Cox model with baseline hazard, Weibull regression model, or an exponential growth model. While the implementation of the technique is not statistically groundbreaking, the inferential improvement is methodological important. The feedback that Mr. Song would receive on his poster presentation would be invaluable. 

Mr. Song has strong quantitative skills. He has selected research methods as his secondary comprehensive examination area. Moreover, he has taken classes in Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Longitudinal Analysis from Dr. Christopher Zorn. He has also taken a course in Game Theory from Dr. John Hsieh. I believe Mr. Song is the kind of graduate student who will truly benefit and value the Method-Meeting experience. He is a serious student who has a definitive research agenda. This is a marvelous opportunity for Mr. Song that would greatly enrich his research skills. I hope that you will strongly consider his application.   

Sincerely,

Martin has performed well in all of these.

In terms of his interests, Martin is an IR scholar who is applying sophisticated statistical methods, informed by formal theory.  He is especially interested in spatial autoregression.  I suspect he will not go on the ""hardcore"" methods market.  However, I could well imagine him teaching methods courses wherever he lands a job.  He could certainly teach all but the most technical methods courses in all but the most technical graduate programs.

very strong quantitative background (BA in political science and MA in

Princeton, he took my advanced statistics courses, which are normally
taken by second and third year students, and was the best student in
the class. Currently, he is a teaching assistant for one of these
classes.  Immediately after that first semester, Aaron and I started
working on a collaborative project on ecological inference.  He is a
coauthor of a forthcoming Political Analysis article.  Through this
collaborative project, I was very impressed by his ability as a
methodologist especially when he solved one of the key integration
problems in our project through the innovative use of line integral
(and he was a first year student at that time!).  In addition to
unusually strong mathematical and programming skills, Aaron has strong
substantive interests in American politics. Before coming to
Princeton, he worked as a data analyst at a polling company in
D.C. Aaron has already published an article in AJPS with his MIT
advisers, and is planning to present his work on electoral campaigns
and micro-targeting, which is a part of his dissertation project. The
summer meeting should provide a great opportunity for Aaron to receive
feedback on this project from other methodologists and get to know
them better. As it should be clear by now, I think Aaron is the most
promising methodology student who will come out from Princeton in a
couple of years, and I strongly urge the committee to accept his

Dear Methods Meeting Program Committee:

I write in support of Larkin Terrie‚??s application to attend the Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. Larkin is a third-year student studying comparative politics, with an emphasis on political methodology. I have gotten to know Larkin this quarter because he has been my teaching assistant for Linear Models, the second-quarter graduate statistics course in the Political Science Department at Northwestern.  Larkin has been an excellent teaching assistant. More importantly, however, Larkin is a graduate student with considerable aptitude for and interest in empirical quantitative methods, in a department in which relatively few students or faculty use such methods.

Like most third-years here, Larkin is in the process of developing a dissertation topic. However, he already has written an interesting and methodologically sophisticated research paper, which he is applying to present as a poster at the Summer Meeting. Previous research has argued that majoritarian electoral rules provide more of an advantage to political candidates that belong to more powerful social groups than do proportional representation (PR) electoral rules do not. While this is not my area of expertise, I gather that the previous research has relied on gender to make this claim, and has shown that majoritarian electoral rules tend to create greater gender imbalances than do PR rules.  These results may be driven by requirements by many West European political parties that a certain percentage of the candidates on their lists be women. In this paper, Larkin‚??s innovation is both substantive and methodological. While previous studies have examined legislators‚?? gender to test the social status hypothesis, Larkin instead examines the ages of candidates to test this hypothesis, arguing that candidates over age 60 are likely to benefit from stronger social networks and financial resources than are younger candidates. While previous studies have used regression analyses, Larkin uses a variety of matching methods, so that the results are less dependent on assumptions about model specification. He uses a variety of such methods, both as robustness checks and to compare the usefulness of the methods. Consistent with the social status hypothesis, he finds that majoritarian systems result in three to five percent more legislators over 60 than do PR systems. While matching methods are not new, they are still not widely used in political science, so this is a methodologically innovative way of looking at an interesting hypothesis in the literature on comparative politics.

Presenting this paper as a poster at the Summer Meeting will be useful to Larkin for two main reasons. First, he can get feedback on the paper from one of few audiences likely to understand the techniques he uses, and he can incorporate this feedback before he considers submitting the paper for publication. Second, because our department has few scholars using quantitative methods, he will benefit greatly from being exposed to a large variety of new methodologies and to the scholars (both faculty and graduate students) in the larger Methods community. 

In sum, presenting at Methods will be useful to Larkin, and I believe that those who go to Larkin‚??s poster will find it interesting. Larkin completed this work last year, so it is ready for presentation.  (Larkin did this research as an independent study with Jay Seawright; he asked me for a letter because Jay is unusually busy right now and I had suggested that Larkin apply to present at the meeting.)

Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Best, 

Anne

to present a poster at the 2008 Summer Meeting of the Society for
Political Methodology.  Alex is ideally suited both to benefit from
participating in this gathering and to contribute meaningfully to it.
He is a promising young political scientist with a distinctly
methodological bent and I am happy to recommend him and his research
without any reservation whatsoever.

I first came to know Alex through his participation in Berkeley's
Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program
(IGERT).  This program is funded by the National Science Foundation
and provides generous fellowships and advanced methodological training
to a select group of doctoral students from across Berkeley's social
and behavioral science departments.  Alex is one of two IGERT fellows
in his political science cohort and one of only seven selected that
year at Berkeley overall.  My course, The Statistics of Causal
Inference in the Social Sciences, is offered as part of the IGERT
curriculum.  Alex quickly emerged as one of the star students in this
challenging class, consistently demonstrating the ability to grasp and
apply the advanced methods I covered.

Alex's poster proposal emerged from work done for this course.  For
the class, he wrote an outstanding paper which employs matching
(performed using the genetic search algorithm I developed) to improve
upon a quasi-experimental study conducted to assess a national civic
education program.  He has extended this analysis such that his
findings both improve upon those produced by other, less rigorous
analyses of these data and contribute to our general understanding of
the ways in which civic education does and does not impact political
attitudes and knowledge among students.  I believe this research is
extremely promising and that it would add nicely to the Summer Meeting
poster session.

Alex's overall substantive interests are in American electoral
politics and political behavior.  In addition to his work on civic
education, he has been involved in research on partisanship, spatial
analysis and community type, including his involvement in research by
Jim Snyder and Steve Ansolabehere on the impact of the transition from
malapportioned representation to 'one person, one vote' on the
urban-rural and liberal-conservative composition of the parties.

Driven by his substantive interests, Alex has shown a great deal of
commitment to mastering the statistical and formal methods necessary
for serious exploration in these areas.  This commitment predates his
entry into our doctoral program.  As an MPP student at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, Alex pursued the most rigorous empirical
methods and microeconomics sequence offered in that program.  He
supplemented that curriculum with classes in regression, game theory
and rational choice at the ICPSR Summer Program in Ann Arbor, as well
as a course on survey research methods with Adam Berinsky at MIT.

Since commencing his doctoral studies, Alex has continued to seek the
best possible methodological training.  He took our department's
year-long formal modeling sequence under Robert Powell.  He has
studied advanced econometrics and behavioral modeling with Henry
Brady, his academic advisor.  He took David Freedman's graduate course
on statistical models in the Berkeley Statistics Department.  He has
even ventured over to the Berkeley Psychology Department for a
graduate-level course on fMRI methods.  Alex also returned to Ann
Arbor last summer to take courses in the ICPSR Summer Program's upper
track, including advanced MLE, scaling and dimensional analysis,
simultaneous equation models, and agent based modeling.  And, after
earning a scholarship to support his attendance, Alex participated in
Don Green's summer seminar on Randomized Field Experiments.  This
rigorous methods training regimen will carry on next year as Alex
pursues a sequence of applied courses in the Berkeley Statistics
Department.

Above all, Alex's ongoing research, including the content of the
current application, provides evidence that this dedication to
mastering the methods of our discipline has already begun to pay
dividends.  During the last two years, I have very much enjoyed
advising Alex as he has developed a series of very innovative projects
that will form the core of his doctoral work.  As I mentioned, he has
taken the time to add fMRI methods to the impressive list of empirical
arrows in his quiver.  These efforts are not simply hobbyist in Alex's
case.  He is in the process of designing an fMRI experiment, to be
carried out at one of Berkeley's fMRI labs, to explore the
neurological bases of partisan identification.  He is also in the
process of developing a randomized field experiment to explore the
relevance of psychological theories of social influence to the domain
of voter turnout appeals, adding a new level to existing work in

He brings to this research both a substantive mastery of his subject
matter and a commitment to apply the most appropriate methods
available to his inquiry.  Alex is one of the most promising young

Rocƒ±o is a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.  But I am chair of her dissertation committee, and she will be on the *political science* job market in the year after next.  She is a methodologist's methodologist; she is exactly the kind of grad student we want and need at the Summer Meeting.    Of all of the students from Berkeley applying this year, she is the BEST (I'm writing letters for everyone who is applying).  And there is a very good chance that she is currently the best methods grad student in the country.

I came to know Rocƒ±o in the summer of 2006 as a teaching assistant for my advanced methods course, The Statistics of Causal Inference in the Social Sciences, in the Department of Political Science at UC-Berkeley. I found her to have great quantitative and methodological skills, which in combination with her enthusiasm and engagement made her an excellent teaching assistant. In the months since our course concluded, Rocƒ±o and I have worked together in diÔ¨?erent research projects, and I have been consistently impressed by the rigor of her scholarship. 

Rocƒ±o‚??s research work is driven by both methodological and substantive interests. On the methodological side, she pursues the development of new research designs and techniques that provide a basis for making reliable causal inferences in the social sciences. On the substantive side, she is fundamentally interested in the empirical study of the institutions of political representation, with a particular emphasis on the role of elections as a mechanism of political accountability. Rocƒ±o‚??s dissertation work aims to combine both interests, an ambitious project only made possible 
by her exceptional background, which combines statistics, econometrics and economic theory with philosophy and political science.

In the last year, Rocƒ±o and I have worked on a joint research paper named Exploiting Tom DeLay: A New Method for Estimating Incumbency Advantage where we propose a new method for estimating incumbency advantage that uses redistricting as an identiÔ¨Åcation strategy. We show that the manner in which previous work has used redistricting to identify the causal eÔ¨?ect 
of incumbency results in biased inferences, making a substantial contribution to one of the most studied phenomena in of Political Science. During our work in this project, Rocƒ±o showed a great capacity for raising interesting questions and great technical skills, making crucial contributions to the project. 

Rocƒ±o is also working on an exciting research pro ject that she plans to present at the Political Methodology Summer Conference. Exploiting a unique randomized natural experiment that took place in the state senates of Arkansas, Illinois and Texas, she provides the Ô¨Årst experimental estimate 
of the causal eÔ¨?ect of the duration of terms on the behavior of legislators. She performs statistical inferences using a randomization inference approach, directly incorporating the random assignment mechanism in the estimation of treatment eÔ¨?ects and testing of hypotheses. Moreover, she formally derives the assumptions implicit in previous work, showing that the causal interpretation of these results is not warranted by the observational designs used in these studies. Rocƒ±o‚??s project takes an extraordinarily rigorous methodological approach to address a question of fundamental importance in the study of the American political system, an example of her ability to apply her strong quantitative skills to substantive research questions. 

Rocƒ±o is currently working on two additional pro jects. First, in a joint research project, we use the research design that we developed in our previous paper to explore whether the interaction between the ethnicity of voters and the ethnicity of incumbents aÔ¨?ects voter turnout. In the second 
pro ject, she studies incumbency advantage in Brazil, a country with a multi-party system where parties have long been considered to play a minor structuring role in politics. In this project, she studies incumbency advantage at the party level, implementing a regression discontinuity design to 
identify the local causal eÔ¨?ect of the incumbency status of a party on subsequent electoral outcomes in Brazil‚??s mayor elections. 

Rocio is a promising young scholar, and I am convinced that her rigorous quantitative training and her broad background in the social sciences will be of great interest to the faculty and students attending the conference. Thus, I recommend her application for the 25th Annual Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology without hesitation.

She completed the advanced course in multivariate methods I taught in the Fall, 2005 term.  This course included structural equation, maximum likelihood, limited dependent variables of many types, and matching estimation methods.  She did demonstrated an excellent understanding of these methods and their applications.  What really impressed me was her independent initiative to explore estimation methods not formally covered in the class.  She would routinely come to class with questions about how some method she had explored differed from the one assigned.  These were always well considered and well developed questions that demonstrated an understanding of the methods.

The analysis she proposes to present is an interesting and important effort to assess the amount of over reporting of turnout in Russian elections, and from that the inflation in apparent electoral support for the Putin regime.  This is an important topic for a broad set of comparative scholars as well as Russian specialists.  

Olesya's English is excellent and she has a very engaging personality.  I mention these attributes only to indicate that she will interact well and extensively with the other attendees and make important contributions to the meetings.

a poster at the 2008 conference.  I met Michio when I arrived at
Michigan last summer.  Mainly my interaction has been working with him
on his so far fruitless effort to pass the Methods prelim exam (as a
minor filed).  The paper he attempted for that involved a matching
estimation to study effects on party ID.  I won't get into the many
problems with it.  The key issue that prevented him passing his oral
exam was that he was insufficiently familiar with regression-based
approaches to the same questions.

Despite that unhappy background, I suggested to Michio that he apply
to attend the meeting in part because the project he is proposing that
uses RDD to study incumbent advantage in Japanese elections has much
greater potential than his party ID project.  If he does pass his exam
(and only if), then I think it would be useful for him to get comments
from some outside people who work in that area.  He needs to hear from
more than just the QMP folks.  There is virtually no chance Michio
will turn into a methods specialist, but best I can tell he wants his
work to consist of sophisticated applications of causal inference
methods.  That's worth encouraging.

As I said, I think an invitation should be extended to Michio only if
he passes his methods exam.  I haven't heard lately from him about his
work on that.  I will tell him I wrote that there should be this
contingency.  Of course, even if this contingent rule is plausible,
there may be other reasons not to invite him.  But he's local, so he
would be cheap, and I think it may help him termendously.

He has an innovative project on Google maps to display this and other information, that is also part of his dissertation. The machine learning project is one we developed afresh to deal with a new set of conflict data on 29 Asian societies. Nils has a MSc in computer science with a focus on databases and machine learning, and we have applied the machine learning perspective to these data, using an out-of-sample as well as cross-validation approach to evaluating predictive performance. 

Much of this work is recently completed and allows Nils to highlight some of the costs and benefits of a machine learning approach when applied to geograpically distributed event data. To date, most machine learning has been used in political science for text classification, and is buried deep down in the applications and publications. This poster shines some light on the actual algorithms and evaluates their potential for the analysis of political events.

I think the poster will present something entirely new, but highly relevant for the community. Nils is an active young researcher who will be a valuable member of our community. I hope you can support his attendance at the conference this summer. If you don't like the machine learning poster, he has a dynamite web application of his project called WarViews, that maps episodes of conflicts onto a dynamic interface with Google maps that might also be a big hit, if posters could be interactive and projected.

Nils and I plan to continue our collaborations, on these and other projects. You also will be delighted with his participation in the conference. I suspect his summer '08 location in Zurich may merit some discussion in your selection process; rest assured that if he is invited to participate in the conference, I'll pay or his attendance, should it not be possible to fund him via the NSF grant.

He took two classes on research methods that I taught and did well in it.  I have not done research with him previously, but recently, he approached me with an idea to study acquiescence response bias in deliverative polls.  He designed a very nice study and convinced Jim Fishkin to incorporate it into one of their upcoming deliberative polls.  The results are very striking - powerful evidence of acquiescence bias and of how question wording can considerably change the apparent results of a deliberative poll.  Although Mike has just gotten the dataset and has not yet been able to carry out thorough analyses exploring mediators and moderators of the effect, I am confident that he will uncover interesting patterns of effects and will have an interesting story to tell at PolMeth if you accept his proposal.","Krosnick","Jon","Professor","Stanford University","krosnick@stanford.edu","650-851-9143","received","1173","Ichinose","Joyce","Manager of the Center  of Deliberative Democracy","Stanford University","jfishkin@stanford.edu","","approved","2065","0000-00-00","Accepted","200","Yes","2008-05-20","2008-05-20","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","210.00","mc_gross = 210.00

Amber is an absolutely first rate graduate student who is sure to make excellent contributions at the meeting and eventually to the discipline.

Amber is a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin, studying American electoral behavior and methods.  She has been a voracious consumer of methods training opportunities.  In addition to taking every statistical methods course offered by our department, she has taken maximum likelihood and game theory in the ICPSR Summer Program, and four courses through the CIC iTV advanced methodology program (Event History, Time Series, Nonparametric Robust Estimation, and Potential Outcomes Inference).  She has excelled in all of these endeavors and earned a ‚??high pass‚?ù on her methods preliminary exam in the department.

Her dissertation, which is still in its formative stage, centers on the substance and structure of mass policy attitudes, how those attitudes are shaped by social and electoral contexts, and the conditions under which legislators are responsive to constituent preferences.  My discussions with her about the project thus far suggest that it has a great deal of promise and I‚??ve agree to chair her dissertation committee.  More broadly, Amber is interested in when and how public opinion matters and the tensions between micro- and macro-level explanations of political behavior.  She is developing sophisticated techniques for getting at these important questions in her dissertation. 

Amber has a continuing interest in issues related to measurement, particularly of latent constructs.  For the last two years she has been a research assistant to Byron Shafer and has worked with him on several projects which explore the ways in which public opinion is organized around particular issue domains (e.g., national security, social welfare, culture), the relationships between issue preferences and presidential voting over the postwar period, and how these preferences reveal a social structure of American politics that is shaped by policy substance.  She has also co-authored an article with Joe Soss, Meghan Condon and Matthew Holleque in Social Science Quarterly that explores the pitfalls of research that exclusively relies upon a particular measurement approach without adequate consideration of theory. 

In summary, I recommend Amber Wichowsky to you without reservation.  She is smart, ambitious, and friendly and will make a wonderful addition to this year‚??s summer methods meeting.

Jun already has a publication in the Journal of Conflict Resolution.  Earlier this year, he won the Peace Science Society Award for the best graduate student paper presentation at their annual meeting.

Jun came to Rochester after completing a PhD in Economics. Since he has been here, Jun has taken five courses in statistical methods, including linear models, MLE, and advanced topics, such as parallel programming, ideal point
estimation, nonparametric smoothing, bootstrapping, and spatial autoregression.  In the courses he has taken with me, Jun has always been one of the top students in the class.

Jun chose to take our advanced methods comprehensive exam, for which he defended a paper making a methodological contribution.  That paper (""Modeling Unobservable Political-Military Relevance: Split Population Binary Choice Model With an Application to the Trade Conflict Debate"") is the paper he has proposed for the conference application.  In that paper, Jun correctly observes that ""no war"" occurs in conflict data  in at least two ways:  when dyads are not ""relevant"" or when they are relevant but the states choose not to go to war.  Rather than assuming an ad hoc definition of ""political relevance,"" Jun models this as a split-population model -- essentially an aggregated version of a bivariate probit model with partial observability. He applies this to the trade-conflict debate and finds that the likelihood of conflict is nonmonotonically related to trade.  In fact, his results help to explain competing results found elsewhere in the literature.

Jun will certainly go on the methods market.  I would place him in the top 3%-5% of all students attending the summer methods meeting.  He should be a definite admit.

Ph.D. student at Princeton, for the summer methodology conference.
Teppei is a graduate student coauthor of the paper I have proposed for
the paper presentation at the conference.  Teppei is the best
Princeton methodology student I have seen (this is my fourth year
here), and is likely to become, in a couple of years, the best
political methodologist coming out of Princeton in recent years.  As
an undergraduate at the University of Tokyo and Oxford University, he
has taken several advanced courses in mathematics, formal theory, and
statistics, and had the perfect score for the GRE quantitative
section.  After joining our Ph.D. program, Teppei has continued to
strengthen his analytical skills by taking several formal and
quantitative analysis courses, in which he did and are doing extremely
well.  In our collaborative project on which our proposal is based, he
has taken initiatives rather than simply following my instructions and
made significant contributions to the proposal as an equal
collaborator.  This paper makes unique contributions to the
statistics/econometrics literature on nonparametric identification of
causal effects by formally establishing the identification region of
the average treatment effect in the presence of *differential*
measurement error.  If Teppei continues to receive training in
advanced statistics and econometrics, I have no doubt that he will
soon begin to make his own contributions to the literature.  Given his
strong background and future potential as a political methodologist, I
believe that it is important for the society of political methodology
to give students like Teppei an opportunity to attend the conference.
We do not have many students who have strong background as well as
interests and so it is crucial for us to keep them involved in our
conferences and other activities.  I strongly urge the committee to
accept his application.","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","received","9909","Imai","Kosuke","Assistant Professor","Princeton University","kimai@princeton.edu","609-258-6601","approved","4796","0000-00-00","Accepted","200","Yes","2008-05-07","2008-05-07","","","","","0000-00-00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","","","","","","210.00","payment_date = 08:03:25 May 07, 2008 PDT

I write to strongly recommend Ian Yohai. I have known Ian since he took a class in advanced political methodology with me. He wrote a paper in this class that is
now to be published in the Journal of POlitics. Ian did so well that I asked him to be my teaching fellow the next year. Students in this category in recent years are
now on the faculty at Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Michigan, Rochester, and other universities.

Ian is primarily a student of American politics, although he has gained considerable methodological sophistication in a variety of areas necessary for his substantive work.
Ian also has an exceptionally good eye for important research questions. As a result, I believe his dissertation project will prove to be a major work in American politics. In this work, he points out that immigration and trade (human and physical
capital) are likely to have very similar effects from an economic perspective, but for some unknown reason the Democratic and Republican parties have each
taken contradictory positions on these issues. Ian is setting out to explain this major under-appreciated puzzle in American politics via a variety of means, including
detailed historical analysis and a massive collection of 70 years of public opinion data.

In addition to being a first rate researcher, Ian is also an exceptional, careful, and talented teacher. When he was my teaching fellow, his numerical ratings were outstanding
(4.85/5) and he earned a formal teaching prize from Harvard. Later, faculty at the Yale Law School asked me to find a graduate student to help them learn about statistical methods and I suggested Ian. They were enthusiastic about Ian‚??s performance in teaching them about causal inference, missing data, and matching
methods, which Ian did in hours of lectures and informal lab sessions.

Ian has now finished one of the three essays of his dissertation, and I suspect that
he will finish next year with the right support.
I strongly support Ian‚??s application. Please let me know if I can provide any further
information.
Sincerely,
~~
