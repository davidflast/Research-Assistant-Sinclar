A great deal of work has focused on the weakly audible voice of economically and racially disadvantaged groups in society.  A multitude of factors makes it unlikely that they will speak very loudly, but Bai Linh focuses on a related but more general problem.  Even when they do speak, their representatives are less likely to listen.   More generally, she argues, voice and listening are two sides of the same problematic relationship.  In the everyday practice of representation between elections, political officials often interact with citizens.  Citizens write letters, go to town hall meetings, attend city council or school board meetings, interact with civil servants who administer programs, and more.  The economic underclass and racial minorities are less likely to participate in these activities, but what happens when they do?  Drawing on the literature in the psychology of perception, Bai Linh hypothesizes that representatives will not identify with these citizens, will pay less attention to them, poorly understand what they are saying, and project their own understanding of a problem in interpreting what these want.  In short, the inattention to poor and minority citizens occurs even when they do participate. Bai Linh has already spent a great deal of time conducting the initial empirical work to illuminate the problems she thinks are at work.  Such an investigation is anything but easy.  Because Bai Linh is studying an old problem from a new angle, there are no well-traveled paths to follow ‰ÛÒ no existing data sets or even well-developed strategies for creating them.  Bai Linh chose to focus her work at the local level, where she could study closely the interaction and communication between citizens and elected officials on city councils.  Most city councils reserve some portion of their meeting time to hear from constituents on issues the council is considering or to learn about other problems that those constituents think important.  But to what extent and to whom do council members listen?  Answering that question requires close observation and the careful coding of what those officials do and say when citizens speak.  Do those officials look at the speaker?  Do they respond?  If they do respond, do they engage the speaker or do they simply offer polite generalities?  And how do these responses vary by the class and race of the speaker?  The second means by which Bai Linh addresses these questions is to interview council members herself, asking them how well they can remember what particular speakers said at the meeting and whether the officials understood what they said in the same terms.  To capture these patterns systematically, Bai Linh and a research assistant have coded a huge number of videotapes of council meetings and the subsequent interviews.  The preliminary results of this investigation are consistent with Bai Linh‰Ûªs expectations.  It is disconcerting how little council members listen to citizens in a way that makes genuine comprehension possible, but race and class are strong predictors of when the communication process is weakest.   Council members are more likely to be inattentive or condescending, and citizens are more likely to express frustration during the interaction.This side of the research has thus substantiated the variable listening that occurs between representative and represented, and the data provide substantial support for her main hypotheses  about the selective listening by the representative.  This is a creative study of the politics of local governance and the social divisions that foster political inequality in American politics more generally.  I realize that Bai Linh‰Ûªs application for the conference may be a somewhat unusual one.  There‰Ûªs no fancy econometrics or clever identification strategy in her work, but she is doing very interesting qualitative work, and I think she would benefit a great deal from attending the meetings.",Hall,Richard,Professor,University of Michigan,rlhall@umich.edu,734-662-5569,received,5751,,,,,,,,,Female,Statistical Models,"My research focuses on the intersection of political representation and race, specifically at the local level.

I support her application with no reservations whatsoever.Chanita is currently a third-year doctoral student and has excelled in the political science program at the University of California, Merced.  From very early on, it became clear that Chanita was the star of her grad school cohort.  She has done very well in both our substantive and our methods courses, including the Experimental Methods seminar that I teach.  In that course, she mastered both theoretical and technical treatments of topics related to the potential outcomes framework and design-based inferences. In addition to her success in our methods courses, Chanita has furthered her methods training by participating in methods courses offered in other departments. These courses include Measurement Theory and Psychometrics and Multilevel Modeling taught by a quantitative psychology group headed by Will Shadish. She is deeply interested in learning about different research techniques and took an ICPSR workshop on Social Network Analysis. Outside of formal courses, she was formerly the lab manager for our Political Science Lab. She was instrumental in setting up the experimental lab and also putting together the lab manual for studies involving physiology measures, such as galvanic skin response. She has presented psychophysiology workshops to research assistants and graduate students. Chanita is self-taught in using experimental presentation and survey programs. She is fluent in a variety of related software including MediaLab, DirectRT, and Inquisit. For some of her research projects, she has coded her experiments from scratch in Inquisit.The poster she is proposing to present for the conference describes an open-source Implicit Association Test (IAT) that she and her co-author have developed. She has conducted a great deal of research using the IAT. Her work with this method includes a project coauthored with me looking at the implicit associations in the minds of respondents as they relate to gender and level (federal, state, local) and type (legislative or executive) of office as well as the two parties.  My collaboration with her has confirmed my belief that she is a first-rate scholar.While the IAT itself is not new, there is currently not a reliable IAT program that is free and open-source for web implementation. Creating an IAT, especially for the web, from the ground up is not an easy task, which is why many people rely on programs that have existing IAT templates. While these programs have IAT templates available, the drawback is that they are generally costly, and some programs do not have online capabilities. Chanita's Easy IAT was developed for researchers to be able to easily use and also modify the existing code for other research purposes.  This will have a significant impact on the ability of scholars to employ and validate the IAT as a measure of various associations.I believe this is important work and I am confident the methods community would benefit from learning about it from Chanita.  I am delighted to recommend this budding methodologist.  Please do no hesitate to contact me for additional information.Best,Alex",Theodoridis,Alexander,Assistant Professor,"University of California, Merced",atheodoridis@ucmerced.edu,5107031260,received,7792,,,,,,,,,Female,Experimental Design,I am a first generation college graduate and am the first in my family to attend graduate school.,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crabtree, who is applying to attend the 2015 Polmeth meeting. Charles is currently a second year student in the Ph.D. program in Political Science at Pennsylvania State University, with a major in Comparative Politics and a minor in Quantitative Methodology. I have known Charles since Fall 2012, when he enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Political Science at the University of South Carolina. When I moved to Florida State University at the end of that academic year, Charles moved to Penn State. We have stayed in close contact ever since and are working on several co-authored papers. From two quantitative methodology classes Charles took with me at South Carolina and from our joint research, I have a very good sense of his background and qualifications.I cannot overemphasize how strongly I recommend Charles to you. He is extremely smart and incredibly motivated to become a truly first-rate scholar. He greatly values the pursuit of knowledge and is exceptionally focused on performing not just well but outstandingly well. He has completed quantitative methods classes through maximum likelihood estimation and is currently taking courses on hierarchical models and measurement. He is also familiar with the literature on causal inference from observational data and the design of experiments. This puts him in a position to significantly benefit from attending Polmeth. He and his co-authors would like to present a poster reporting the technical details and results of a dynamic IRT model that models GDP and population as latent variables, incorporating multiple self-reported and objective indicators of each construct as well as predictors of measurement error. I think the Polmeth meeting would be the perfect place for them to get methodologically sound feedback on their paper.Please give Charles' application your strongest consideration and do not hesitate to contact me with any questions at (603) 277 0336 or hkern@fsu.edu.",Kern,Holger,Assistant Professor,FSU,holger.kern@me.com,6032770336,received,2653,,,,,,,,,Male,Causal Inference,NULL,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have known SÌ_nke since I met him as an undergraduate student from Germany in a summer game theory course I taught in Europe. Since then, I trained him at NYU in three graduate level classes: in Experimental Methods, Game Theory, and Formal Models of Voting. In all classes SÌ_nke was diligent and performed well, turning in papers equal if not superior to his colleagues. As his advisor and dissertation chair, I know SÌ_nke has been meticulously working on designing his formal theory experiment, which is a central part of his dissertation. SÌ_nke has already conducted the experiment, receiving financial support from me and additionally, has won a competitive grant at the Center for Experimental Social Science at NYU to conduct future sessions.When does contestation, he asks, lead to more selfish choices on the distribution of chances? Can voters achieve equality of chances under competition? SÌ_nke shows the contingency of expressed other-regarding behavior on institutions. The experiment is clearly innovative; this experiment has great potential to improve our understanding of behavior in multi-stage contests, research that has received attention from political scientists and economists alike. His work is not only going to be of highest interest for scholars of redistribution, voting, and of course, conflict, but also, will provide great insight on endogenous other-regarding preferences, namely, on preferences for relative well-being that are too often modeled as exogenous. In fact, it is a general strength of SÌ_nke‰Ûªs research - as shown in several projects he has developed - to seek ways to understand how the validity of particular assumptions made in behavioral formal models might be affected, and driven by political institutions and incentives. In how far are ‰ÛÏnatural‰Ûù preferences hard-wired, as compared to being shaped by genuine political phenomena?SÌ_nke‰Ûªs proposal is one step into finding an answer for this important question, and Polmeth can lead him even further.  Judging from my experience at previous polmeth meetings, I see greatest potential in SÌ_nke‰Ûªs proposal and therefore  strongly urge the selection committee to consider him for the polmeth meeting.Best, Becky",Morton,Rebecca,Professor of Politics,New York University,rebecca.morton@nyu.edu,212-998-3706,received,9706,,,,,,,,,Male,Experimental Design,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has a terrific project that is certainly ‰ÛÏposter-ready‰Ûù for PolMeth, if not for the main conference program.

I have known Jane for about seven months now, and during that time she has been a research assistant and a grader. In both of these roles, I have been extremely impressed with Jane‰Ûªs intelligence, technical abilities, and diligence. Although we are not currently collaborating on any projects, I have had a number of conversations with her about her research and I would be thrilled to collaborate with her in the future. She is exactly the type of graduate student that should attend the Summer Methods Meeting, and I hope we can convince her to be active member of the Society throughout her career.Jane plans to present a poster based on a paper that extends and refines results on the differential funding of subnational governments. Previous work has shown that co-partisanship between central and subnational governments is associated with greater subnational funding. Unfortunately, relatively few subnational governments are selected in a manner that allows for co-partisanship to be measured. In order to extend this result to additional countries, Jane argues that the important part of the co-partisan relationship is responsiveness to the central government‰Ûªs agenda. She develops an alternative measure of this responsiveness and demonstrates that previous work has only been able to tell half of the story. Jane shows that there is an important non-monotonicity in this relationship that has been missed. This is interesting work, and I am fully confident that jane will have a very strong poster ready for the summer meeting.On a more personal note, it is a pleasure to work with Jane. She is genuinely curious about many areas of methodological research, and she often asks insightful questions during talks. In summary, Jane is an extremely talented person who would greatly benefit from attending the summer meeting, and the summer meeting would greatly benefit from her attendance. I strongly suggest that she be allowed to attend the meeting and present her poster.Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information. Sincerely, Adam Glynn",Glynn,Adam,Associate Professor,Emory,adam.glynn@emory.edu,6179131919,received,2141,,,,,,,,,Female,Bayesian Models,"I contribute to diversity in two ways.

Stephen will be on the job market this fall in his six-year. I met Stephen about three years ago in a graduate class I taught. He did well in the class, and I‰Ûªve enjoyed working with him on various projects since then.Voters say that, when it comes to their voting decisions, some aspects of candidates are much more important than are others, such as candidates‰Ûª policy views, educational background, prior government experience, etc. They also say that other aspects of candidates are much less important, such as their racial background, gender, identity, etc. Stephen‰Ûªs job-market paper investigates whether, when it comes to candidates, voters actually remember what they say is important to them. It‰Ûªs part of his broader dissertation on the influence of candidate biographical traits.Based on a number of experiments, he finds interesting patters in what voters remember and in what actually affects their voting decisions. On the positive side, he finds that respondents in his studies do remember hypothetical candidates‰Ûª policy positions on some issues. Even several days after he briefly told respondents about the candidates, they can still remember their positions on salient issues like gay marriage, though not on other issues like education, veterans‰Ûª policy, and energy policy. On the negative side, respondents appear to forget immediately about other aspects of candidate that they say are almost as important, such as their educational background or prior government experience, but do remember traits they say are unimportant, such as gender and race. The findings raise concerns about voter competence, suggesting that voters may not remember what they believe is important to them.‰ÛÄStephen will continue to follow up on these promising findings this year, trying to understand why voters so easily forget about some aspects of candidates that they say are important. He will also investigate what candidates and the media can do to help voters remember these qualities.Stephen‰Ûªs dissertation is still somewhat on the early side, but it is promising. Besides conducting numerous experiments, Stephen has also supervised a massive data collection program on candidate ads. Along with Travis Johnston, another Berkeley graduate student, they have had undergrads supplement the data on the Wisconsin advertising project by coding other aspects of the ads. The coding focuses on the personal content and on how members frame policy appeals with regard to their backgrounds, such as their expertise, shared identities, etc. With these data, he will be able to examine whether his experimental findings appear to hold in real-world campaigns. Moreover, his data will allow him to test other predictions about campaigns and provide a resource for other researchers.Steven has a number of other projects, including an interesting methodology piece with Laura Stoker, which she will talk about in her letter. He also has a co-authored piece on the media‰Ûªs role in assigning blame to president Obama for the oil spill, which is worth taking a look at.In closing, I reiterate my support for Stephen.

A savvy methodologist, but not someone who had used text analysis much, she was wondering how she might do this automatically.  I gave her some tips, but did not expect her back for a while, since most students take months to learn and apply these types of methodologies for the first time.In two weeks, Mona was back.  She had not only implemented the algorithm and cross-validated it, but she had learned a great deal on her own about supervised learning and had optimized her model so she could predict bureaucratic discretion with high accuracy.  I was astounded at how quickly she had learned the methods and the efficacy with which she had applied them.Mona‰Ûªs application of classification and regression trees is important, creative, and unique.  I have not seen supervised methods applied to laws in the way in which Mona has applied them.  Mona is able to get very high accuracy in part because legal texts have a predictable structure and as such their attributes relate in a predictable way to the their implementation.  I imagine that there are numerous applications of these methods to legal texts.  Prediction of leniency and discretion in laws has huge implications for politics.  Mona‰Ûªs dissertation finds that bureaucratic discretion often has better local outcomes in the case of education, but only arises in certain political situations, when preferences between governors, legislatures, and bureaucrats are aligned.  I imagine that Mona‰Ûªs measure has the potential to become widely used in this literature.I think this will be the beginning of a research agenda for Mona applying classification to laws to predict bureaucratic discretion.  She would certainly contribute to Polmeth this summer with her research, and I think she would benefit enormously from feedback and input from other methodologists.  I strongly recommend her for admission to the conference.All the best,Margaret RobertsAssistant ProfessorUCSD",Roberts,Margaret,Assistant Professor,UCSD,meroberts@ucsd.edu,360-921-3540,received,5421,,,,,,,,,Female,Text Analysis,"My biggest contribution to the group is my education and policymaking background, which is substantiated by my work experience in school districts, a state department of education, a state legislature, and two education research centers.",1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will say more about her poster application in a bit, but one of the most striking features of her skill set is her creativity and imagination in application of these ideas to areas of American politics (interest group activity on civil rights issues in the judicial process) that fall very far outside the usual political behavior studies.Her poster will document the effects of the 2009 Iowa Supreme Court decision establishing the right to same sex marriage on the political activity of opposition groups, the net of which resulted in the public‰Ûªs vote not to retain three of the justices in the majority (an exceptionally unusual outcome). While the popular story may be that conservative religious groups in the state mobilized an unusual number of voters to reject the justices, Allison shows otherwise. Using a synthetic control method (Abadie, Diamond, Hainmueller 2009), she shows that while Iowa‰Ûªs turnout did increase in the 2010 election, the level of increase was not appreciably different from that of appropriate comparison states. What did happen in that election was that roll off fell dramatically, and that Iowa voters in 2010 cast decisions on race considerably further down the ballot than comparisons to the synthetic Iowa would suggest.Her results make eminent sense. The conservative groups probably did not overcome the voters‰Ûª usual costs of voting to encourage greater turnout, but they did apparently induce the voters to pay more attention to the election.Allison is really something different: a minority woman with exceptional empirical skills.

He first took my class in quantitative research methods. I have since had him in advanced quantitative research methods, qualitative and experimental methods, political behavior, and political psychology. He performed at a high level in all of these courses. Given his strong performance in classes, I asked him to work on a book chapter with me, on major policy developments in homeland security and terrorism. He is currently working on his dissertation project, and I am serving as chair of his dissertation.Early in his coursework, Paul asked about creating an independent field in political psychology to complement his other field of comparative politics, and we were able to accommodate this request. He is the first student going through our program who is doing such a field, and I am advising him, along with Bill Crano. This is very rare for a student of comparative politics and I think this particular blending of fields will yield new insights for comparative politics. Given his specialty in this area, he has gained had a lot of exposure to experimental methods.In his dissertation, Paul seeks to understand why some autocratic systems grant economic rights to minority groups who press for political rights while others do not. What is unique in Paul‰Ûªs research is that he is drawing from work in social psychology to help inform his expectations. More specifically, Paul draws on the Context-Comparison/Leniency Contract model, developed by Crano and Alvaro (1997), to help explain why pushing for rights in one domain may lead to concessions in another domain. According to this account, minority groups are more likely to obtain concessions in a political system when they are able to attain favored status and have a strong persuasive message. While elites do not change attitudes in the domain the group is pressing for (i.e., political rights), the messages lead to indirect change in attitudes in other dimensions, in this case, economic rights. Paul plans to test these arguments with a combination of cross-national survey and experimental data collected in an autocratic country. For the summer methodology meeting, he would like to present the results of the survey data.Paul will greatly benefit from being able to attend the meeting. He will not only get valuable feedback on his work, but he will get exposed to a wide range of scholars using a variety of methodological approaches.In sum, I recommend Paul for the meeting.

The poster he is going to present at the summer meeting is one such example. It analyzes aggregate voting records using a partial observability probit model, allowing him to study situations where individual roll-call votes are unavailable. The poster, as well as the paper it based upon, is presented clearly and accessibly.Moritz will be a valuable addition to the summer meeting.

The canonical example is that most undergraduates report personally binge drinking infrequently, but believe that most other undergraduates do binge drink frequently‰ÛÓboth can't be true. A similar phenomenon may be occurring in politics. Since extreme statements and confrontation capture the news media‰Ûªs attention, extremism gets disproportionate media coverage, and voters may wrongly believe that extremity is the norm among other voters. So, even if most voters are moderate, they may tolerate extreme politicians because they think those politicians are widely supported by other voters. Usually graduate students struggle to come up with a feasible project on an important issue. This project was Doug's first dissertation idea.Moreover, it's already paying off. Recently, the Journal of Politics, which is a top-three journal in political science, accepted Doug‰Ûªs first article from his dissertation for publication. It's a good article and a testament to Doug's academic skills. Doug's project also suggests a potential remedy for polarization among politicians: if voters realized that most other voters were actually moderates, they might be less tolerant of extreme politicians.Doug and I have worked closely on another project: whether open primary reform, where any voter can vote in the primary for any candidate, helps reduce the growing polarization among politicians. In this project, Doug exemplified all the skills necessary for a successful career as an academic. He did an excellent job designing the experiment, implementing it, which included interviewing a representative sample of 4000 registered California voters, analyzing the data, and writing up the results. In 2012, California adopted an open primary for many elected offices. Just before the election, we asked registered voters who they would vote for on the actual ballot they would see on Election Day (treatment group) or on a closed ballot where they could only vote for candidates of their own party (control group). To our surprise, we found no sign that voters tended to vote for more moderate candidates on the open ballot (or for candidates closer to them on the issues). The results are disappointing for proponents of primary reform and suggest that we should look elsewhere to solve the problem of polarization. The paper is forthcoming at LSQ.In closing, I reiterate my strong support for Doug‰Ûªs proposal. If you have any questions about Doug, please feel free to contact me by e-mail (glenz@berkeley.edu) or by phone (510-575-9971).Sincerely,Gabriel LenzAssociate Professor",Lenz,Gabriel,Associate Prof.,UC Berkeley,glenz@berkeley.edu,5105759971,received,5408,,,,,,,,,Male,Experimental Design,NULL,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karen is a fourth-year graduate student who is becoming a talented political scientist. I know Karen through her work in my semester-long courses on linear regression and spatial data analysis. She performed well in both classes, and she applied the geospatial analytic tools she learned to publish a well-written, solo-authored article in Conflict Management and Peace Science about protests during the Arab Spring. She has also gone on to develop a deep understanding of Bayesian statistics with her advisor, Ryan Bakker, and she participated in the 2014 ICPSR summer institute as a Clifford C. Clogg Scholar.This year at PolMeth, Karen would like to present work from her dissertation in which she models de facto judicial independence of courts in 191 countries over 34 years from 1980-2013. To do this, she has developed a Bayesian latent variable model in which she measures three dimensions of judicial independence--social, political, and economic--with a variety of indicators. She predicts nations' scores on these dimensions based on the political environment. The importance of her work is twofold: First, Karen substantively shows that economic and social judicial independence are not necessarily associated with more democratic states, but democracy is critical for political independence. Second, she provides a valuable measure of three aspects of cross-national judicial independence that will be of use to other scholars interested in the impact of an independent judiciary. She intends to make her independence scores, and the corresponding measures of uncertainty, freely available through her Dataverse page. Karen would benefit a lot from attending the summer meeting. She is methodologically talented, does excellent research, and is receptive to feedback. Participating will be beneficial to her dissertation as she finishes it this coming year, as well as to her ongoing research agenda.

I am the Director of Alexa‰Ûªs dissertation and she has worked under my supervision at the Center for Survey Research (CSR) of which I am the Director.  I thus know her work well. Alexa plans to present a poster at the meeting on the application of item response theory to survey measurement. More specifically, she applies item-response theory (IRT) to the measurement of partisanship in several European nations (the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands), assessing the properties of a new multi-item partisan identity scale.  Her IRT analysis demonstrate the greater power of items in the scale to differentiate among partisans at the weaker end of the identity spectrum when compared to existing measures, thus providing more complete information about partisan strength than researchers have obtained in the past. Alexa also studies the invariance of the new 8-item scale across the three countries within an IRT framework and finds that it is indeed measuring the same thing in all three nations (despite very different levels of partisanship). In this paper, Alexa demonstrates the measurement properties of the partisan identity scale across these four nations and shows that regardless of differences in scale attributes the identity scale has similar political effects. The scale makes an important contribution to political behavior research, outperforming the standard single-item measure as a predictor of electoral campaign activity and political misperception. Alexa‰Ûªs presentation of her research findings, and her general participation in the conference, is important for several reasons. First, it will provide an opportunity for her to present and discuss the IRT technique, and its use to assess measurement invariance, to other political methodologists in order to gain helpful feedback on her work. Second, she is a very good methodologist, having taken a series of sophisticated methods classes at Stony Brook University, including Stanley Feldman‰Ûªs measurement class, and it would be good for her to establish a strong network of political methodology colleagues. She has also taken a course at Stony Brook that included maximum likelihood limited dependent variable models. She has taken a course at Stony Brook on multi level modeling. She also studied Bayesian estimation at the ICPSR summer school. Third, she also has considerable experience in sampling and other aspects of survey methodology through her work at the Center for Survey Research at Stony Brook University. Her attendance at the meeting will provide her with further up-to-date information on latest trends and techniques within the collection and handling of survey data. ‰ÛÄOverall, I strongly support Alexa‰Ûªs attendance at the Political methods meeting.

I believe that Anna is an excellent candidate for this program because of her excellent progress she has made in the program and for her potential for empirical research in comparative politics. She is very good at quantitative methodology, but would benefit greatly by participating in this conference and present her work.Beyond her classroom performance , which has been quite excellent in all the seminars she has taken from me (and from others courses as well,  from what I hear from my colleagues), Anya has been one of the most research active graduate students in the department. Not only has she presented several papers at major national conferences in political science, but she has been a coauthor with me on a piece entitled ‰ÛÏEnvironmental Degradation and Genocide‰Ûù that appeared in the journal Ethnopolitics  in 2012. Her conference presentations have included papers presented at the American Political Science Association, the Midwest Political Science Association, the International Studies Association and the Southern Political Science Association. Currently she is working on her dissertation (I am her chair) on the politics of fiscal federalism. In her dissertation she develops a theory that explains  the politics of the distribution of funds from the center to the regions and municipalities in Russia. She has defended her prospectus and is writing her dissertation, which she plans to finish in the summer of 2015. Anya was also my research assistant, and was a graduate editorial assistant with the American Political Science Review. She is extremely organized, and manages time well. She  also communicates well, has always been very receptive to feedback, and has always behaved in a professional manner. In particular I have seen her behavior at a number of conferences, and her presentations were extremely well done, organized and professionally done. She also responded to questions and criticisms very well.Not only  am I current chair of her dissertation committee, but I was also her research mentor at Truman State University, where I spent 18 years  before taking up a position as Professor of Political Science at the University of North Texas in 2008.  I knew Anya both as a student of mine majoring in political science at Truman, and later as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar, a federally funded program designed to prepare undergraduates from first generation college and low income families for graduate school. I was Director of that Program from 2004-2008.   Thus I know Anya very, very, well.  She is a native speaker of Russian (having emigrated from Russia to the United States as a teenager) but is also a native English speaker. I cannot speak more highly of Anya-- she is one of my most favorite persons.However, I do believe that she is a work in progress.

BoehmkeTo Political Methodology Selection CommitteeI am pleased to write this letter in support of Shuai Jin‰Ûªs application for the 2015 Summer Meeting. Jin is an exceptional student who shows all the signs of being an overwhelming success and someone who would fit in well at the conference. I recommend her without reservation.I have known Jin for almost three years now as she is a third year student in our PhD program. She has enrolled in four classes of mine and I have served as DGS for most of her time in our program. I therefore believe I have good insight into her strengths as abilities as a student. She excelled in all my classes, both methods-focused and otherwise. This past fall her project won the award for best poster in my advanced methods class as voted on by other faculty. To be blunt, Jin represents the standard by which I have evaluated other students in all the classes she has taken with me. She is already among the five best methods student we have had at Iowa in my fifteen years here and her pursuit of ever more advanced methods knowledge leads me to believe the chance of her being the best is quite high. The paper she has proposed for the conference merges her interest in public opinion, particularly in China, with methods. It arose a year ago after a conference the department hosted on public opinion in China, which included presentations on various survey projects in China. She became interested in the sampling methods that these studies were using and I suggested she investigate it for one of her class papers. In addition to studying the various methods for estimating possibly clustered or multilevel data, which has done a few times in the past, she went a step further by linking the estimation strategy to the data collection strategy. Thus in her Monte Carlo analysis she designs a handful of different clustered and stratified sampling strategies and then compares the performance of different estimators across each sampling approach. The paper therefore makes a nice contribution to both data collection and analysis ‰ÛÒ rather than making a single recommendation for an estimation strategy, it fits its recommendation to study design. Further, it also should prove valuable for future surveys (and not just for those in China, obviously) as it informs how they may wish to structure their sampling procedure. In addition, Jin is working on a number of other interesting methods projects, including one that we are coauthoring and plan to submit as a poster. In short, Jin would be an excellent addition to the conference. Please let me know if you any questions or if I can be of further assistance.Frederick J.

Matthew has been a student in my class, he has worked as my research assistant since 2013, and we are now co-authors on a research project, so I feel well-suited to comment on his skills, potential, and fit for the conference.  Matthew is well on his way to becoming a top-notch political methodologist. Matthew has proposed presenting from a project on which I am a co-author, along with Victoria Dunocous (Duke Political Science PhD student) , Zhengming Xing (Duke Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD), and Larry Carin (Duke Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty).  We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model to jointly analyze Catalist voter file data, congressional roll-call votes, and associated legislative text in order to examine 1) the extent to which the legislative behavior of members of Congress align with the preferences of constituents and 2) the implications of alignment (or lack thereof) on subsequent election outcomes.  The project bridges and contributes to both the machine learning and political science literatures. Briefly, the analysis is based on a Bayesian nonparametric formalism, with fast inference via a stochastic variational Bayes. Matrix factorization is integrated with the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), yielding a statistical characterization of people living within each US congressional district. A topic model is used on the text of the legislation. The latent district-level feature vectors of the people living in each district and the topic distribution on a given piece of legislation are used to infer roll-call votes. Within the model is a component that allows inference of the degree to which a given legislator votes in a manner aligned with the preferences of his or her constituents.  The initial methodological-focused paper from this project is currently under review at Bayesian Analysis. Matthew is working on an extension that will estimate the ideal points of relevant constituency subgroups to evaluate if members represent the interests of some subsets of the population more than others.   Given Matthew‰Ûªs proposed presentation is for a project with a large research team, I want to emphasize that Matthew has other impressive political methodology projects underway.   Matthew recently presented his single-authored paper, ‰ÛÏIntegrating Turnout Uncertainty into Pre-election Polls with a Probabilistic Likely Voter Model,‰Ûù at the annual meeting of the Southern Association of Public Opinion Researchers.  In this paper, Matthew improves on standard likely vote models with a probabilistic likely voter model constructed as an overdispersed Bayesian posterior distribution on candidate preference proportions. Another project, co-authored with a Stanford PhD candidate (and former Duke MA student),  has been accepted for a paper presentation at the 2015 APSA Meeting.  In that project, they will marry textual analysis and Bayesian IRT methods to jointly model political news viewership and the latent traits of local news broadcasts to estimate the ideal points of shows and viewers.  Matthew is an exceptionally bright, motivated, and productive political methodologist---a perfect fit for the conference.  The only hitch: he is an undergraduate, completing degrees in statistics and mathematics at Duke University this spring. Matthew has been accepted into to many top political science PhD programs (if I were to bet, I‰Ûªd guess he will end up at Stanford to work with Justin Grimmer). Normally, I would not view PolMeth as an appropriate conference for an incoming graduate student, but Matthew is not a normal incoming graduate student.   He has been working on innovative statistical research projects for the last 2 years‰ÛÓin addition to the projects already mentioned, he has been a research assistant for David Dunson (Duke Statistics).  I just learned that he received an award last week at the 2015 American Statistical Association DataFest, an annual data analysis competition where teams of up to five students have a weekend to attack a large, complex, and surprise dataset.  Matthew really is exceptional.  He is also a terrific candidate for travel support because he will be in the awkward position of being in-between institutions.One last thing I want to note: Matthew is not only smart and motivated, he is also a delight to be around.  Matthew is from a working-class family in Oklahoma and has that classic Midwestern disposition‰ÛÓpolite, respectful, and hardworking.   In sum, Matthew has the intellectual capacity, disciplined work habits, and pleasant disposition that make him a perfect addition to the PolMeth community.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.",Hillygus,Sunshine,Associate Professor,Duke University,hillygus@duke.edu,6173881076,received,9971,,,,,,,,,Male,Bayesian Models,,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have worked intensively with him for more than three years at Berkeley, and I have continuously been impressed by his analytic sophistication and capacity to come up with new methodological insights and initiatives.We are currently collaborating on a major project on the challenges of medium-N analysis. Let me give an example of what happens again and again. At one point, I came up with a new question about the error-proneness of certain categorical measures. Forty-eight hours later I received an e-mail from him, with a link to findings he had promptly generated: simulation results that address my question, and an interpretation of the simulations.

However, in his case I feel safe with the prediction, given the unusual level of analytic skill, the talent at taking novel initiatives, and the capacity to deliver on those initiatives. This is combined with a strong substantive focus, which is crucial for the success of a professional methodologist in our discipline. His work on the welfare state is innovative and exciting, and his committee includes scholars who are international leaders in that field.So, excellent methods, excellent substance.

At this point in his graduate career, his skills are comparable to those of Betsy Sinclair or Fred Boehmke ---each of whom early in their graduate careers were working on projects that had significant methodological content and who were producing publication-quality research early in their careers.Lucas' has a broad skill set, with a strong foundation in discrete choice models, ecological inference, and causal modeling.  He is extremely talented with large datasets, and is quite knowledgeable about database matching and linkage.  He has great Stata and R skills, and has a strong methodological intuitions.At this point in his career, Lucas has begun a project that uses a large array of voting station data from recent elections in Argentina, taking advantage of a change in election procedures, to study the canonical question of whether voters behave strategically in Argentina's unique political party system.  He will be presenting this research at MPSA as a poster.  His second major project is a collaborative venture involving myself, Ines Levin, and Lucas; we are using multiple waves of survey data from Latin American nations, with mixture models, to study the question of who participates in extreme forms of political behavior (especially protests).  This second paper will also be presented at MPSA.  Lucas also has a third major research project in the works, with myself, Welmar Rosado, and Thad Hall, studying the political behavior of veterans of the Armed Forces in recent U.S. Presidential elections.All this is meant to argue that he is a strong methodologist, and at this stage of his career, he will benefit enormously by being able to participate in the summer methods conference.Finally, I'd like to add that Lucas has recently become the graduate editorial assistant for Political Analysis; thus his participation in the summer meetings will help him develop a stronger sense for what the current interests are of meeting participants, which will of course help Jonathan and I do our jobs as editors better.  If you need additional information, please let me know.Michael Alvarez",Alvarez,Michael,Professor,Caltech,rma@hss.caltech.edu,626-395-4422,received,7381,,,,,,,,,Male,Bayesian Models,NULL,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have known Ryan for about 2.5 years now. I have had him in a class and he has asked me to be a member of his dissertation committee. I know him and his work fairly well. Put simply, Ryan is a perfect candidate for PolMeth. He's very bright, he's interested in important substantive questions, and he is very technically able. I strongly encourage you to invite him to attend.Ryan has excellent skills in formal theory and very good empirical skills. He has recently been very active in acquiring skills related to text analysis. His skills in this area are currently very good and rapidly improving. He is one of a handful of students that I have most enjoyed working with since coming to Berkeley 5 years ago. What is perhaps most exciting about Ryan is that he is genuinely motivated by substantive questions and he really cares about getting the empirical details right. He has a lot of technical skill but that skill is always employed as a means to better understand what is really happening on the ground. The project that Ryan is proposing to present as a poster is a good example of this. Ryan has long been interested in separation of powers issues in the US. A key aspect of this is the advise and consent power of the Senate-- particularly as it relates to the appointment of Article III judges. Ryan and a co-author have embarked on a large-scale data collection exercise to gather the text of statements made at judicial confirmation hearings. They use a structural topic model to characterize the main topics of the hearings and to then analyze how topic propensities vary across and Senators, nominees, and time. I think this has the potential to be a very strong paper that could eventually appear in one of the \big 3\"" general audience political science journals. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carlos will be Princeton's best comparative politics student on the job market this year.  His presence at the conference will benefit him as well as those who are hiring in the field of comparative political economy this fall.Carlos has compiled three impressive papers on dynastic politics, a timely topic given the likely match-up of Bush and Clinton in the upcoming presidential election.  These papers are all based on the original data collection from the 18th century Europe, the 19th century Britain, and the 20th century India.  In each case, Carlos used web and pdf scraping to compile a comprehensive data set of dynastic politicians, election results, and various constituency variables.  He then uses a creative identification strategy, exploiting the death of European kings, the expansion of franchise in Britain, and Indian independence, to understand the origin of political dynasties.  In addition to these empirical contributions, Carlos develops an original theory, which shows how political parties rely on these dynastic politicians in districts where party organization is relatively weak.  This reliance on dynastic politicians, in turn, hinders the development of party organization, leading to the further persistence of political dynasties.  Carlos' theory explains the prevalence of political dynasties in democracies.  In contrast, previous theories did not consider political parties and their predictions are in contrast to his: the absence of political parties means that dynastic politicians can run in districts where their party has a strong organization.  This dissertation will make a great book and you will be impressed with his work like I have been.Beyond this unique dissertation project, Carlos has a variety of other papers.  They include a paper with Gary King and myself that uses the randomized evaluation of Mexican conditional cash transfer and health insurance programs to examine their electoral effects.  We point out the methodological flaws of a previous study and show, with a new set of evidence, that these programmatic policies have little electoral impacts.  Carlos and I are also working on a methodological paper in causal inference exploring how to appropriately decompose the causal effects of policies on electoral results into the mobilization and persuasion effects.  Finally, Carlos also has a structural estimation paper on central bank decision making in a reputable economic journal and a variety of ongoing exciting projects.In sum, Carlos is an impressive young scholar who studies comparative political economy with sophisticated empirical methods.  Attending this conference will be critical for him given that he will be on the job market this fall.

Zach recognized that, despite several recent papers using multiplicative interaction terms in ADL and error correction models, there is no extant guidance on how such specifications work in the presence of multiple lag- and difference terms. Under my supervision he undertook to do the (tedious) algebra necessary to describe what various model specifications imply about conditional relationships.  Further, he developed the link between interaction terms and existing frequentist theories of inference for time series models.  The result is, to my knowledge, the first time any has bothered to collate these results in one place for the benefit of applied modelers.  His work is at a stage where presentation of his findings at PolMeth will be useful to the discipline and enormously beneficial for him.  I encourage you to accept his poster and, if possible, provide him with funding to help defray conference expenses.               Please contact me with additional questions.John S.

Mr. Zhirnov is an extremely promising young scholar with superb abilities and powerful motivation, a comparativist and a methodologist, with very strong background in the wide range of quantitative as well as formal methods of analysis.  As a scholar of comparative politics, Zhirnov does cross-national research on the role of segmented interests in party system development. In his various projects, he addresses various theoretically inter-linked aspects of this relationship. Thus in a dissertation fragment that he encloses with his package, he inquires in the role of fixed-assets-dependent sectors of the economy in investing financial resources in the stability of party systems in their respective countries, as a pathway to ensuring relative economic policy stability. Elsewhere, he reverses the question, and makes it his concern to link under-protected (politically) economic interests with the entry of new parties. That paper has an involved theoretical construct and empirical design, since, in Zhirnov‰Ûªs model, economic interests in need of a party and the voting coalition being mobilized on behalf of such a party are not necessarily congruent (the latter exceeds the former). Understandably, being engaged in that and related research, Zhirnov is also an expert in elections, electoral systems, and electoral design. His expertise extends both to the proficiency in empirical aspects of the subfield, as well as in formal theoretical work on electoral systems, party systems, and electoral competition. Some of his own work fits in this category.As a political methodologist, Zhirnov is superbly trained and supremely capable. In addition to his background in our graduate program, he attended the ICPSR Summer Institute at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in the Summer of 2011, participated in the EITM in the Summer of 2012, and also took part in the by-invitation Methodology Summer Workshop ‰ÛÏInstitutions in context: Inequality‰Ûù at the University of Tampere, Finland, in the Summer of 2013. It is indicative of the regard in which his skills are held in our department that he is repeatedly requested as a TA for advanced courses for both quantitative and formal graduate sequences (except this year he holds a Dissertation Fellowship, so he is not doing that). Zhirnov‰Ûªs dissertation is cutting-edge research into the subject of translation mechanisms between segmental economic interests and political parties. His theoretical view is essentially Madisonian. As per his committee‰Ûªs recommendation, his dissertation is unified by the theoretical chapter and proceeds as a collation of related articles. We expect the defense in the Spring of 2016. Meanwhile, Zhirnov is shepherding several articles through the journals‰Ûª pipelines while working on several current projects. His energy is overwhelming. You can see it in his conference participation record. In addition to presenting at numerous professional meetings of political scientists, Zhirnov also participates in the Meetings of the Public Choice Society frequented for the most part by the economists. He presented twice at invited conferences (NYU and Tampere), and co-organized a conference himself (Binghamton).Sincerely yours, Olga ShvetsovaProfessor of political science and economics",shvetsova,olga,professor,binghamton university,shvetsova@gmail.com,607-777-4230,received,7875,,,,,,,,,Male,Statistical Models,NULL,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carly is one of our most accomplished and promising graduate students.Carly Potz Nielsen already has a good amount of methods training. As an undergraduate at Texas A&M she took a number of engineering courses as well as intermediate regression analysis. As a graduate student in political science here she has taken maximum likelihood inference from Ben Bagozzi and James Hollyer's game theory seminar. She also is taking a macroeconomics class in our applied economics department. Last fall, I taught Carly in our methods core seminar. This course is motivated, in part, by the EITM project. It covers both rational choice theory and political methodology. Carly wrote fine papers and an excellent final exam. In one paper she critically evaluated the way macro political methodologists conceive of social structure; she illuminated problems in this regard in works on cross sectional time series (panel) analysis, spatial modeling, and multivariate time series modeling. In her final exam she evaluated the contributions of Signorino and other proponents of strategic discrete models in achieving progress in political science, among other things, challenging Clarke and Primo's critique of EITM. In her second essay on the final exam, she  reviewed some debates about rational choice, including Gary Cox's defense of rational choice theory. And she criticized rational choice theory for its static conceptions of equilibrium. Carly's presentation in class and contributions to class discussion were excellent. This summer she plans to attend the ICPSR summer program, taking courses on Bayesian statistics and network analysis.The research design paper Carly wrote for my core course is the basis of her proposal for this summer's meeting. In it, Carly promises to perform a strategic analysis of an important problem in comparative politics: the principal-agent relationship behind external sponsorship of local rebels. She explains why a major published work on this subject is flawed in its use of conventional discrete choice models and how she will use Bas et al.(2008)'s approach to constructing a likelihood function that captures the strategic elements of the sponsor-rebel relationship. But she will go further addressing the problem of missing data on actor decisions. In particular she will apply the censored strategic probit model (Nieman 2013) to address this missing data problem. Through her work in our maximum likelihood class she has gained the necessary skill in R to carry out the promised analysis. Carly is sure to benefit from presenting this work in Rochester and from interacting with other users of these and related estimators.In sum, Carly Potz-Nielsen has the training, research agenda, and scholarly promise one looks for in a graduate student attendee of methods meeting. I therefore give her my highest recommendation.John Freeman",Freeman,John,John Black Johnston Professor,University of Minnesota,freeman@umn.edu,612-624-6018,received,5801,,,,,,,,,Female,Statistical Models,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Across the board Ethan conducts highly transparent research, such as filing research plans that pre-register his research design ahead of his experiments with EGAP.While Ethan is not developing any new estimators, he belongs to a cadre of scholars who are pushing to increase the transparency of the experimental community.

He is keen to become a seasoned researcher and has invested quite a bit of time to develop his methodological training. To that effect, he has taken a number of courses in econometrics and he spent the summers of 2013 and 2014 at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research to take courses in advanced Bayesian models, structural equation models and time series analyses, among others. These courses have been extremely helpful for his dissertation, for which all the data have been collected.Eric is extremely well prepared to benefit from a participation in the Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.

This proposal stems from a joint project we‰Ûªve been working on for more than six months.  Last year, I assembled a team of four graduate students to respond to the Polinformatiics Challenge that John Wilkerson and his colleagues issued.  Our idea was straightforward: we saw a major stumbling block in the ‰ÛÏBig Data‰Ûù approach was its inability to establish reliable time series because of its essentially inductive nature.  The key theoretical hypothesis was that during the financial crisis we should observe an increase in uncertainty in the hearings process on financial matters.  We measured collective uncertainty by generating topic models based on the statements made by participants in the hearings, and then calculated entropy coefficients, allowing us to follow entropy reliably though time.While all of us contributed, Robert Schaffer was the critical workhorse of the project.  He ran and modified the topic models, and has contributed to the development of the set of ideas that have begun to emerge from this quite massive study.  He participated in the Polinformatics conference last fall, where we received  come great comments on the project from the participants.  So I know first hand how good Robert is, and how hard he works.

I have known Ted for two years, having been his instructor in two courses: the second and fourth semester courses in our graduate applied statistics sequence.  Ted was the highest performing student in both courses.  Furthermore, he is well on his way to becoming a top methodologist and political economist in the field.Ted has a top mind when it comes to connecting method, theory, and empirics.  He can implement and develop innovative methods, but he always stays grounded to interesting substantive questions. Over the last few semesters, I have been involved with Ted in two projects. The first, in an advisory role, was an RD in Brazil; basically, on one side of a population threshold, districts follow a first-past-the-post election rule, and on the other side, it is PR.  Ted identified the RD, spent time in Brazil gathering the data, and produced an analysis examining the effect of voting rules on coalition size.  The paper was well received by both comparativists and political economists in our department.Concurrently, Ted has been working with me on a project.  Ted worked with Josh Clinton at Vanderbilt prior to arriving at Princeton, and they had several successful projects.  With me, Ted has continued his work on scaling.  I've got a method that simultaneously scales text and votes; Ted generated code that fit a dynamic version of the model, using the model from Harrison and West that motivates Martin and Quinn's judicial scores.  Over the course of this last summer and semester, Ted taught himself scaling methods including NOMINATE, IDEAL, and the dynamic Martin-Quinn models, on top of a full course load and several other projects.I anticipate writing a longer, and more involved, recommendation for Ted in a few years.

I have known Michael since he started graduate school, and he frequently participates with several graduate students and faculty members in the Human Nature Group, a weekly discussion meeting dedicated to exploring multidisciplinary approaches to social science.Michael is an innovative thinker.  He is currently focused on the relationships that exist between social groups and how they influence political and economic outcomes.  In particular, he has developed a model that attempts to recover the latent class structure of a society given the existence of identifiable social groups. His work is very interesting methodologically, as it shows that his model performs as theoretically expected using Monte Carlo simulations. But it also has important substantive implications, as he applies the model to experimental data from individuals living in Chennai, India. The results show that there is a significant and facially-valid ordering of caste sub-groups along a latent social dimension in India. He also validates the model using out-of-sample data that measures within-group and between-group marriage ties in India. As a result, the model improves our understanding of the general formation of social network ties in India.I think PolMeth would be a fantastic experience for Michael at this stage in his career.  He is learned enough to take full advantage of the presentations and feedback he gets on his project, and I fully expect he will be hooked on the conference for years to come.In sum, I think Michael is an extremely qualified candidate for your support.

He's taken a variety of methods classes here at Harvard, both in the department and at the Statistics department. Not only that, but he has translated that interest into actual methods papers, even at this early stage of his graduate career. As a third year graduate student he has a methods/IR paper accepted at JCR (with Michael Bailey and Erik Voeten). His methods interest include how to model time-dependent data, which is a huge area in political science. Finally, Anton received great course evaluations for both his knowledge of statistical methods and his ability to communicate those methods. His project is a good demonstration of both his interests and his abilities. He wants to study the problem of \truncation by death\"" or attrition. He wants to combine the Robins framework with the Rubin principal strata approach to these problems.

I think she would make a great participant.Rury is completing her third year in our program and has taken four classes from me, including three in methods and one on applied formal modeling. She received an A in three of the courses and an A- in the fourth. She has worked as my research assistant in the past and I currently serve as her dissertation advisor and therefore know her abilities and research well. Rury has deep interests in methods driven by her substantive interest in judicial politics and has worked to acquire the skills to pursue those methods in her time here at Iowa. I have been impressed by her ability to steadily learn new material on her own with modest guidance. For example, in addition to materials covered in courses in the department, she has learned about and applied techniques for network analysis in her work and has recently started learning about latent path models as well. I expect that she will be an applied consumer of new methodological developments and occasionally dabble in developing or tweaking existing methods.Her poster proposal constitutes a typical example of the results of her pursuit of methods. She came to Iowa with a J.D. and an interest in judicial politics and is developing a dissertation that will study the evolution of law within the U.S. across state and Federal courts by adapting theories of diffusion. This will involve text analysis of judicial decisions and network analysis of the spread of decisions and precedent both vertically and horizontally. Her poster proposal represents a first piece of this broader question by examining the citation network across states using opinions in the area of judicial conduct. To this end she has started to learn Python and various web scraping tools as well as working with text parsing software to facilitate gathering the citation data for more legal issue areas. The methodological contribution here involves the nature of network statistics such as centrality, betweeness, etc. These are usually taken as given, but her work has highlighted the fact that they are often drawn from samples (i.e., one area of law, or just using cases decided) and may include various forms of measurement error. Thus she develops a bootstrapping approach to generate measures of uncertainty for network measures. This allows explicit tests of claims that, e.g., one actor is more central than another. She illustrates this technique using her data as well as through replication of existing studies accounting for uncertainty.Given all of this, I think Rury would make a good participant in the summer meeting and would get quite a lot out of it given the prevalence of network scholars. She may not be at quite the same high level of technical skills as some of our other applicants, but she is solidly in the range of graduate student participants that I have observed at the conference over the years. Further, I think she has a genuinely interesting methods question at the center of her proposed poster that ought to be of interest to people working in the field and ought to result in a publication that makes a nontrivial contribution.Please let me know if you any questions.",Boehmke,Frederick,Professor,University of Iowa,frederick-boehmke@uiowa.edu,319-335-2342,received,9204,,,,,,,,,Female,Causal Inference,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the research assistant front, I have yet to meet another person who is as able as Kim to make ambitious plans and stick to them. 	 In addition to a strong substantive interest in comparative immigration policy, Twist also has a deep interest in methodology, especially in the area of public opinion. Indeed, her deep interest in better understanding survey methodology has led us to co-author an article comparing observational and experimental methods for public opinion research. We started with a puzzle somewhat outside Twist‰Ûªs main area of expertise: a large number of observational studies indicate that the US Supreme Court cannot lead national public opinion, while a smaller number of experimental studies indicate that it can. We theorized that this discrepancy might stem from the way in which researchers and national media transmit Court opinions to the American public. We fielded a two-wave nationally representative survey before and after major Court decisions, in which some respondents were exposed to information through the media they regularly use, while other respondents were exposed to information from us, in the course of an experiment. Twist participated in every stage of the design of the survey, and then tirelessly collected data on how different television programs framed Supreme Court decisions. She reviewed all the methods literature; created a very detailed codebook and ensured undergraduates reliably completed their coding tasks. Our study helps address significant concerns about the external validity of survey experiments, which are the main tool public opinion researchers now use. The paper Twist proposes to present this summer focuses on an important feature of experimental work: attitude scales. Using a variety of data sources, she shows that traditional, abstract scales for measuring respondent opinions generate different - and possibly, less accurate - results than do scales labeled with specific policies. She also demonstrates that abstract-scale effects can differ based on the type of issue attitude being measured. Her project speaks to a variety of work on experimental design.	Twist benefited tremendously from the 2014 conference, and I am therefore enthusiastically recommending her enthusiastically for the 2015 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. She will benefit immensely from this opportunity to receive feedback and will contribute helpfully and eagerly to others‰Ûª projects.

Unfortunately for UB, she has been admitted to several higher-ranked, more quantitatively-focused programs and will be transferring in the fall.# Why You Should Accept Her Poster Proposal(1) Kelly's abstract is not an idea, but a summary of a nearly complete (and well done) project. Before submitting the paper to a journal, I've only recommended that she slightly change her recommendation from Bayesian MCMC w/ Jeffreys prior to a bootstrapping, so that the paper maintains a consistent frequentists perspective.(2) Kelly is a very enthusiastic scholar and will benefit greatly from attending the conference. First, her paper will improve. I can attest from experience that Kelly is a wonderful student who takes feedback very seriously. I am confident that discussing her poster both formally and informally with faculty and other graduate students will improve the paper. Second, Kelly will begin to develop a network of quantitive researchers, including both graduate students and faculty. She is very interested in becoming a part of the PolMeth community and will certainly take advantage of opportunities such as the Women's Dinner. In particular, she'd benefit from connections with other women involved in methodology research.(3) While she is only a second-year PhD student, it is not too soon for Kelly to attend the conference. In my view, the only potential negative of Kelly's application is her relative inexperience. However, I still believe that she is a strong candidate for acceptance and funding. She is noticeable more mature in her scholarly work than I was as a second-year PhD student, for example.# Why She Should Receive Funding(1) While Kelly is a strong candidate, the Department does not offer much financial support to graduate students‰ÛÓshe will very likely pay out-of-pocket a large fraction of the cost of attendance.(2) While one cannot easily project one's career path, I suspect that this will be a good investment. I believe that Kelly is likely to remain actively involved in the PolMeth community as a graduate student and professor. I suspect that she will pay it forward, serving as an excellent mentor for future young methodologists. In sum, Kelly is a strong candidate for acceptance and funding because she has a complete project that is ready for public presentation and she will learn from conversations at the conference and begin to build networks.

Fredrik is going to be a star methodologist, and you should invite him to PolMeth. He has my highest recommendation. I came to know Fredrik during his stay at UC Berkeley as Visiting Scholar the previous academic year. Since then, I have worked with him on several projects and have also become familiar with his own research.Fredrik has a deep understanding of causal inference and empirical methods in general. His grasp of the aptness of different methods and the implications of their assumptions in real applications is especially noteworthy. His is technically well trained, works hard, and has a broad knowledge of quantitative social science.I first met Fredrik when he attended my course in causal inference. He showed great interest and was one of the most active participants. He made very astute and smart comments in class. We soon continued our discussions outside of class. While these were mostly focused on general topics and his research ideas, Fredrik regularly came with insightful and helpful comments on my own ongoing work. This led to he and I working on some projects.For PolMeth, Fredrik has proposed to present work on threshold blocking. A common method to reduce the uncertainty of causal inferences from experiments is to assign treatments in fixed proportions within groups of similar units--i.e., blocking. Previous results indicate that one can expect substantial reductions in variance if these groups are formed so to contain exactly as many units as treatment conditions. This approach can be contrasted to threshold blocking which, instead of specifying a fixed size, requires that the groups contain a minimum number of units. Fredrik investigates the advantages of the respective methods. In particular, he shows that threshold blocking is superior to fixed-sized blocking in the sense that it, for any given objective and sample, always finds a weakly better grouping. For blocking problems where the objective function is unknown, this need, however, not hold and a fixed-sized design can perform better. He presents new theoretical results and empirical examples. It is wonderful work.Fredrik is a wonderful person to have around.

Gabriel is a PhD student at Princeton who specializes in comparative political economy. Gabriel is one of the brightest students we have at Princeton.  He is well trained and has done well in my advanced graduate methods courses.  Gabriel will be on the job market this fall with a good number of papers.Gabriel's dissertation research is about monetary policy making in the federal bank.  Many scholars believe that the central bank independence makes monetary policy making insulated from political influence.  Using various empirical strategies, Gabriel shows that the members of the federal open market committee are also greatly influenced by their political considerations.  This contrasts with the previous literature that has found evidence for the central bank independence.  The problem of these previous studies is that they focus on the analysis of voting, leading to the apparent consensus among the committee members.  Gabriel shows that the political bias enters at the stage of deliberation.  He analyzes the speech records and committee member recommendations to estimate ideological positions and political biases of each member.  Remarkably, these biases are influenced by the committee member's appointment process and partisanship as well as their assessment of local economic conditions in the region they represent.  Relatively little work has been done in the political biases of central bank decision making in political science.  Gabriel's dissertation represents a major advance in this literature.In addition to his dissertation, Gabriel has several coauthored papers.  Among the papers I know, he has written papers with Leonard Wantchekon, Matias Iaryczower, and Marc Ratkovic (all different papers).  From this record, you can see that he is a productive and promising scholar who is likely to do well in the job market.

Zining is applying for your 2015 Summer Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology. Her distinguished graduate record clearly differentiates herself from all other nascent scholars, translating into a level of maturity, capabilities and drive for knowledge discovery rarely surpassed.  When she asked me to write this letter of recommendation, I was quite pleased for the opportunity to share with you my evaluations of her performance.Zining is a proactive, conscientious scholar, driven by the pursuit of doing things in a better way.  Unlike most of her peers, she is not afraid to challenge common wisdom, not for the sake of challenging, but for understanding. This trait of a natural scholar serves her well indeed.  Her skills in organization, peer interaction and delivery of quality products are likewise superb.  As a result of her stellar performance and commitment to excellence, Zining is certainly in the top 5% of all graduate students I have come across; truly exceptional and unusual in talent. I first met Zining as a student in my Social Network Analysis, System Dynamics and Agent Based Modeling classes.  As advanced modeling courses, Zining brought to bear on tough problems the desire to grasp difficult mathematical modeling concepts unsurpassed by all other graduate students.  Despite the steep learning curve, each week she would go beyond required materials and bring me new ideas for applications beyond the scope of the courses.  Her ability to connect real world policy concerns and objectives with theory and empirics quickly developed to a high degree of verisimilitude. I subsequently invited Zining to become my main research assistant in a team of 4 other students as well as my teaching assistant for all my methods classes. First, the challenge of formalizing political economy natural language theory into mathematical specifications is immense to begin with.  Zining excels equally at formally specifying various models or computational algorithms as well as programming them. She deftly understands new mathematical concepts and theoretical specifications. Second, she has a strong ability to convey concepts and methods using a variety of examples, whether mathematical, anecdotal, verbal or visual, to colleagues.  Third, her sincere demeanor inspires those around her to collaborate and excel, a rare trait indeed. Moreover, her methods skills have been recognized by the entire faculty, as we have mader her instructor for teaching intro and advance mathematics courses for our first year graduate students.Among young scholars pursuing answers to these questions, I firmly believe that Zining will make lasting contributions not only in teaching, but moreover, to the field in general. I look forward to watching Zining‰Ûªs scholarship blossom over the next few years and know that the POLMETH will only propel her further.

Ben is a fourth year Ph.D. student at Princeton.  Ben is likely to be on the job market this fall as an Americanist who is interested in bureaucratic politics and institutions.  For this reason, it would be very helpful if he could attend the summer methods conference and present his research.While he is an Americanist, Ben has acquired a significant set of methodological skills.  He is the most methodologically sophisticated student in his cohort at Princeton, and as a result, he has served as a teaching assistant for my graduate level advanced methods course and also has taught the statistical programming camp to other graduate students in two years in a row.Last year, Ben presented our joint project which developed the statistical methods to simulate redistricting maps from a population of valid maps under certain constraints (e.g., equal population, geographical compactness).  The paper is currently under review at a top statistics journal and we are now working on the application of this method to examine the relationships between redistricting and political polarization at both federal and state levels.The methodological challenge of simulating redistricting maps from a target population is that there are a combinatorial ways to divide a state into districts.  As a result, currently no method has a theoretical guarantee in terms of obtaining a representative sample from this vast population of all possible redistricting plans.  This computational problem impacts the performance of both optimization and sampling.  We reformulate the redistricting problem as a graph-cut problem where the nodes represent geographical units (e.g., precincts and census blocks) and the edges indicate contiguity.  We then extend a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in computer vision to develop a method that yields a representative sample of redistricting maps.As you might imagine, this project involves a heavily statistical and computational aspect.  Although we have two other collaborators, Ben was the leading force in this project.  He understands all the statistical aspects of the paper and implemented our very complicated MCMC algorithm in C++.  This was not a trivial task given the fact that we had to use various efficient graph theoretic algorithms available in the igraph library.  In any event, this shows that even though he is not a pure methodologist, Ben is well trained and can apply his top-notch methodological skils to important research problems.The poster Ben is proposing is part of his dissertation project about lobbying and bureaucracy.  He has collected a unique data set on lobbying from Wisconsin.  Many scholars used the federal lobbying reports which have become publicly available as part of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.  However, the problem of this popular data set is that it does not tell you whether or not each lobbying activity is done for or against a particular bill.  In contrast, the Wisconsin data set Ben was able to acquire contains this information.  Using this unique data set, Ben conducts the most comprehensive empirical analysis of ``venue choice'' in the literature by examining whether a company lobbies bureaucrats or politicians in any given issue.  I think this will be a valuable contribution to the literature.Beyond these projects, Ben has another paper of his own, looking atthe question of whether firm concentration in the regulated industryor congressional lobbying determines the regulatory policies.  He isalso working with Dave Lewis of Vanderbilt using a unique andcomprehensive data set of federal employees.  Their data set containsalmost all federal employees and their career history (the positionsthey had within federal agencies and their salaries and otherinformation).  My understanding is that they already have a draftpaper, which will be submitted to a journal soon.  Together, he willhave a strong file when he goes on the job market in the fall.In sum, Ben is a technically sophisticated Americanist who benefitsgreatly from attending the conference and presenting his work.  Hewill be on the job market this fall and so everyone who is hiring anAmericanist should check out his excellent work.  I encourage theselection committee to invite him to the conference.",Imai,Kosuke,Professor,Princeton University,kimai@princeton.edu,6092586601,received,6604,,,,,,,,,Male,Bayesian Models,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her proposed project is ground breaking in several respects, including methodologically. She has created a tractable, sophisticated way of measuring what she calls the \outside-options bargaining-power\"" of governing parties", which she conceptualizes as the viability times the attractiveness, from the party's perspective, of alternative governments to the incumbent that this party could join. The more palatable are these outside options, any bargaining model tells us, the stronger the bargaining position of the party. Maiko points out that, although something like this outside-options bargaining-power motivates many party-bargaining models, it does not actually make an appearance in many government-formation models or in any ministerial portfolio-allocation models. Meanwhile, empirical models of multiparty government formation, dissolution, and policymaking have ignored this reversion-point leverage entirely, using seat-weighted averages or other forms. Maiko, as I said," shows how to measure \""outside-options bargaining-power\"" and does so for every party in every parliament in every developed democracy since World War II", and then shows how this properly conceptualized and measured index explains (1) multiparty-government portfolio-allocation (the topic of this paper), (2) multiparty-government policymaking in the composition and size of budgets, and (3) formation and durability of multiparty governments themselves.

With this aim, I focus on Congressional amendments for which a recorded vote is available. This provides ideologically-labeled text for which I can control for the topic, akin to knowing both the status quo and the proposed alternative. This frees up the text model to identify substantive content with the aid of identity recognition and dependency parsing. I allow the meaning of text to vary by subject areas," which are identified by reference to sections of the US Code (which most bill text modifies).

I have known him since he enrolled last fall in my Ph.D. seminar on ‰ÛÏSocial Media and Political Participation‰Ûù.  At that time, he also joined the NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) lab, of which I am a Co-Director.As a seminar participant, Kevin was a model student.  He participated in discussion with insightful points, wrote excellent response papers, and submitted an outstanding final paper (more on that momentarily).  He received an A for the course, which is strong in any case but especially impressive for a first year student.Since that time, I have only become more impressed with Kevin‰Ûªs potential as a scholar as I have worked with him on the process of turning the research proposal that he wrote for my course into a full fledged SMaPP lab paper that is now ready for submission for publication; the current version of the paper will be sent out for review in the very near-term future.Kevin‰Ûªs original proposal (the term paper for my class) was to explore whether or not we could use social media data to test propositions about elite behavior in times of crisis the emerged from the formal literature.  More specifically, Kevin wanted to test the prediction that opposition elites would focus almost exclusively on the crisis in an effort to draw attention to it and increase its salience for the general population, while government elites would attempt to flood the information space with lots of different messages as a strategy for reducing the salience of the crisis.  This is an interesting ‰ÛÒ and to a certain extent counter-intuitive ‰ÛÒ proposition, as we might expect governing elites to present a unified message refuting the claims of the opposition.Kevin‰Ûªs idea was to use the Twitter feeds of Venezuelan members of parliament from the 2013 Venezuelan protests to test the empirical support for these hypotheses.  Twitter (and other forms of social media) have presented social scientists with hitherto unimaginable treasure troves of data, but figuring out exactly how to harness these data to test theoretically relevant hypotheses in social science is a much more challenging task.  Kevin came up with an extremely creative way to use Twitter feeds to test the theoretical model.  First, he pooled all the tweets of opposition members of the parliament in the period of time preceding, during, and following the protests.  Then he did the same with governing party members.  Using these two separate datasets, he then conducted unsupervised topic modeling (using machine learning techniques) not to focus on the content of the topics themselves ‰ÛÒ although that also proved interesting ‰ÛÒ but instead to generate a daily measure of how much each group was focusing on a limited or broad set of topics.  Building on this initial insight, Kevin then worked with the rest of the SMaPP lab (through presenting his research ideas to the labs, working with our programmers, and soliciting feedback from the lab faculty supervisors) to come up with a very creative method for measuring this degree of focus versus dispersion (relaying on something called a Shannon Entropy measure, which was developed for use in computer science) among the Tweets made by Venezuelan members of parliament.  The results were quite dramatic: both opposition and elites look fairly similar in terms of their focus on different topics in their tweets both before and after the protests, but during the period of the crisis, opposition members of parliament were much more focused on a limited number of topics than the members of parliament from the governing party. We believe this is an excellent example of how we can use social media data to test extant theory in exciting new ways.With this paper almost ready to go out the door, Kevin has become an eager participant in a SMaPP project utilizing multiwave surveys to analyze the effect of social media usage on information acquisition and voting behavior among both British and US citizens in the run up to national elections in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  While these projects are in an earlier stage of development, we are absolutely thrilled to have him working with us on them.In sum, Kevin has been a fantastic student and an exemplary member of the SMaPP lab, and I expect only the best for him as his graduate career continues. He is also very collegial, and I have found working with him to be a pleasure. Furthermore, he has proved himself extremely receptive for suggestions on how to improve his work, a trait that I personally feel is highly correlated with eventual quality of scholarly output. I therefore strongly support his application to attend Polmeth this summer.Please do not hesitate to let me know if I can be of further assistance.",Tucker,Joshua,Professor,New York University,joshua.tucker@nyu.edu,212-998-7598,received,2986,,,,,,,,,Male,Text Analysis,NULL,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kayla is a superstar doctoral student at the University of California, Merced with a distinctly methodological bent.  I have taught two of the four courses she has taken in our methods sequence, beginning with Research Design during her first semester of graduate school.  Kayla has absolutely excelled in this sequence, including Quantitative Analysis I, Research Design, Regression, and Experimental Methods in Political Science.   She did particularly well in the Experimental Methods course, which I also taught, and she is preparing to take Maximum Likelihood Estimation in the fall semester.  She is, by quite some margin, the best methods student in her cohort and I would say her abilities as a scholar and potential as a methodologist are as promising as any graduate student I have come across in my years as a grad student at Berkeley (including as the graduate student instructor for that program's most advanced methods course) and during my participation in several capacities (student, coordinator, faculty mentor) in the EITM program.  Kayla arrived with little background in methods, but it quickly became apparent she was able to master even the toughest material.  Her training, hard work, intellectual curiosity and natural ability were on full display in my Experimental Methods course. The course is rooted in the potential outcomes framework and design based inference and covers randomized experiments in the field, lab and embedded in surveys, as well as natural experiments (e.g. RDD) and approaches to causal inference using observational data (matching, IV).  She performed spectacularly in the class.  She was quick to grasp the theory underpinning the methods we covered as well as their practical application.  This is especially true with regard to matching, the application of which is central to her PolMeth proposal.  She also fielded a very clever survey experiment on the role of gender in respondent perceptions of candidates in the context of various scandals.  In the end, she earned the only A+ in the class.Kayla already has a very active research agenda.  She is working with my colleague Tom Hansford on an NSF-funded project related to public opinion regarding the judicial system.  She is also currently coauthoring a project with Matt Hibbing that analyzes the physiological basis of framing effects.  She and Chelsea Coe have been invited to present this work at the upcoming Hendricks Symposium at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and at the International Society of Political Psychology summer meeting.It was her success in my classes and her well-earned reputation as a methods star in our department that led to our collaboration on the project she and Chelsea Coe have proposed to present at this year's Summer Meetings.  This project is extremely promising, in my opinion.  It is rooted in the finding that several studies show a persistent asymmetry in the level of partisan intensity among Republicans and Democrats.  Kayla and Chelsea are using Sekhon's genetic optimization matching algorithm to establish balance on key covariates between Democrats and Republicans.  They are doing this using my data from several studies (inlcuding thousands of respondents), to examine the extent to which these asymmetries persist.  This work is part of a larger paper the three of us are producing on the topic.As someone who has presented multiple times at PolMeth (both in the graduate student poster session and a faculty lecture), I know this project is ideally suited for the graduate student poster session.  It will be of great interest and should generate considerable discussion.  I also know that Kayla (and Chelsea) is exactly the kind of young methodologist who would benefit from participating in the meetings and would add to the sessions nicely.

Chelsea is, in many ways, the most impressive student, among several excellent classmates, in our graduate program.  She excels in methods, has nicely developed substantive interests in behavior, and already has a very active research agenda.  She has been a student in two of my classes, Research Design and Experimental Methods, and she performed superbly in both.  I know her and her research interests quite well and I recommend her with no reservations whatsoever.  She is as good as any graduate student I have taught, both during my time here, my time at UC-Berkeley (including as the graduate student instructor for that program's most advanced methods course) and during my participation in several capacities (student, coordinator, faculty mentor) in the EITM summer program.Chelsea added a great deal to class discussions in both seminars she took with me, and she has an excellent reputation among my colleagues as well.  She clearly understands the scholarly enterprise and and has a decidedly methodological bent.  She is very entrepreneurial when it comes to leaning new methods and seeking out collaborations helpful in her pursuit of research questions.  Many of the methods and tools we discussed in class (and which she pursued further on her own) have quickly become central to her research and the projects she is pursuing with several of my colleagues.  In particular, she is working with Steve Nicholson and Tom Hansford on manuscripts.  She is also currently collaborating on a project with Matt Hibbing that analyzes the physiological basis of framing effects.  She and Kayla Canelo have been invited to present this work at the upcoming Hendricks Symposium at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and at the International Society of Political Psychology summer meeting.As part of her efforts to advance her training as a scholar, Chelsea became a regular at office hours and clearly spent the time necessary to master methods, techniques and literature on her own.  For example, she very quickly has made herself fluent in R and the packages needed for her work.  She is very dedicated to research.  In just her first year, she became the first graduate student from our department to present at the APSA Annual Meetings.  She presented two papers, both of which were very well received. In fact, the chair of one of these panels wrote a letter to our department chair about her skills as a presenter skills and the quality of the project.She has become very familiar with experimental methods and the statistics of causal inference and is currently the lab manager for the Political Science Lab.  In that role, she has added value to the research of several faculty and grad students.  She also has some background in Cognitive Science and that affords her a perspective different from that of many Political Science colleagues. She is able to apply this perspective while still remaining focused on the literature to which she seeks to contribute and the cutting edge methods of our field.The Research Design and Experimental Methods courses she took with me are heavily rooted in the potential outcomes framework and design based inference and cover randomized experiments in the field, lab and embedded in surveys, as well as natural experiments (e.g. RDD) and approaches to causal inference using observational data (matching, IV).  Chelsea was like a sponge absorbing these methods and the approach clearly resonated with her.  She quickly built a solid foundation in matching methods, the application of which is central to her PolMeth proposal.  She designed a novel survey experiment on public opinion regarding the courts.  She did an excellent job in both classes, earning an A in Experimental Methods and the only A+ in the Research Design class.It was her success in my classes and her well-earned reputation as productive scholar in our department that led to our collaboration on the project she and Kayla Canelo have proposed to present at this year's Summer Meetings.  This project is extremely promising, in my opinion.  It is rooted in the finding that several studies show a persistent asymmetry in the level of partisan intensity among Republicans and Democrats.  Kayla and Chelsea are using Sekhon's genetic optimization matching algorithm to establish balance on key covariates between Democrats and Republicans.  They are doing this using my data from several studies (inlcuding thousands of respondents), to examine the extent to which these asymmetries persist.  This work is part of a larger paper the three of us are producing on the topic.Again, Chelsea is a home-run candidate to present this work at the summer meetings.  I fully support her application.  As someone who has presented multiple times at PolMeth (both in the graduate student poster session and a faculty lecture), I know this project is ideally suited for this venue.  It will be of great interest and should generate considerable discussion.  I also know that Chelsea (just like Kayla) is exactly the kind of young methodologist who would benefit from participating in the meetings and would add to the sessions nicely.  Please to not hesitate to contact me with any questions.Best,Alex Theodoridis",Theodoridis,Alexander,Assistant Professor,University of California Merced,atheodoridis@ucmerced.edu,5107031260,received,9058,,,,,,,,,Female,Experimental Design,I'm female and also first generation American.

In his dissertation research, Yiqing develops a new methodology for causal inference in time-series cross-section data which unifies the difference-in-differences, synthetic control methods and fixed effect regression methods under a single framework and improves efficiency and interpretability. He has already drafted a paper which primarily focuses on the technical aspects of this methodology and he is expected to go on a job market this fall with this paper. Based on the outstanding quality of this draft as well as his track record that includes a publication in APSR and multiple R&Rs in other top journals, I expect him to be a very successful job candidate. In the proposed poster, he will focus on the applied side of his dissertation project and present results on the causal effect of election-day registration (EDR) laws on voter turnout, where the existing research has suffered from the methodological problem (i.e. violation of the so-called \parallel trends\"" assumption) which his methodology directly addresses. He has already completed data analysis and found remarkable results", including a significant positive sample average treatment effect overall (contrary to some of the recently published papers on the same topic) as well as large degree of heterogeneous causal effects among early and late adopters of the EDR laws. Overall, the quality of this research compares favorably to any graduate student poster I have seen at the conference in my view," and for this reason I strongly recommend that Yiqing's application be accepted to the conference.""",Yamamoto,Teppei,Assistant Professor,MIT,teppei@mit.edu,6172536959,received,4072,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Male,Causal Inference,,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was a computer science, math, and philosophy undergraduate student at Bucknell, where he also co-founded the local chapter of the National Society for Hispanic Engineers. He is co-advised in IST by Lee Giles (coPI of the IGERT, best known in information retrieval, e.g. CiteSeer) and David Reitter (who has also worked with political scientists, such as Vito d'Orazio.)Alex is focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning, with particular emphasis on deep learning models. Deep learning models are a slight sideways move from the connectionist / neural net models that appeared to hit a dead end some years ago, but have now had a resurgence with some new insights into architectures and estimation procedures, as wekk as some dramatic improvements above state of the art. (See, e.g., http://www.wired.com/2014/01/geoffrey-hinton-deep-learning).Alex has had four papers accepted for peer-reviewed conferences (that's where computer scientists publish, primarily) in his first year and a half.The IGERT students undergo research rotations in interdisciplinary projects / labs / centers, and Alex is this year working with me on various social science text analytics projects. The proposed poster introduces deep learning models to the political methodology community and frames them with reference to well known topic models and related latent measurement approaches like factor analysis and IRT.I think there is tremendous potential value-added from integrating Alex into the political methodology community, and this builds on the unambiguous benefits that have come from people like computer scientist Hanna Wallach recently attending.Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.Burt",Monroe,Burt,Associate Professor,Pennsylvania State University,burtmonroe@psu.edu,814-867-2726,received,5992,,,,,,,,,Male,Text Analysis,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She‰Ûªs taken multiple classes from me and is one of the best methods students we‰Ûªve had here at Iowa. She has attended the summer meeting the last two years and is like to continue to do so as the transitions from student to faculty (she is scheduled to defend her dissertation in May, so she will have her PhD in hand by the time of the conference).Schilling‰Ûªs main methods area has been spatial econometrics, which she uses in her dissertation to study interdependence in legislators‰Ûª decision making. Her early work in graduate school led to a paper with Jude Hays and myself in which we develop an approach to estimate spatial duration models with right censoring. She has extended this on her own to develop an estimator for competing risks with spatial dependence (which she presented at last year Summer Meeting).This year, Schilling is a coauthor on a paper that I submitted. In this paper, along with Jude Hays, we explore the issue of missingness in spatial regression in general. Because observations depend on each other, listwise deletion can lead to bias to even with MAR or MCAR data, particularly if there is spatial dependence in the independent variable that mimics that in the dependent variable. Thus this paper continue our earlier work and relates directly to Schilling‰Ûªs specialization in spatial econometrics. Schilling is a very good methods students and is the kind of student who has enjoyed participating in the Summer Meeting the last two years and who is likely to continue attending after she receives her PhD. It would therefore make good sense to admit her again. Please let me know if you any questions.Frederick J.
